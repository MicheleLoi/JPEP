# 5. Signaling Discontinuity from Prestige System

Section 4 established that short-term positioning outside traditional prestige structures can enable long-term transformation through identifiable mechanisms. The first component of infrastructure implementing this strategic positioning is explicit discontinuity from traditional academic metrics. This means establishing a journal or special track within an existing journal that does not initially seek indexing in traditional databases, does not count toward tenure or promotion decisions, and deliberately opts out of prestige competition. The venue serves methodological contribution over credential accumulation. This discontinuity creates design space for three principles that would prove difficult to implement within traditional structures: ecological validity, good faith orientation, and a cost structure that makes honest participation the path of least resistance while simultaneously serving as costly signaling of genuine scholarly commitment.

## 5.1 Ecological Validity

Discontinuity from credential pressures enables procedures that work in actual scholarly practice rather than serving dual purposes that create tension. Traditional venues mix credential conferral with knowledge advancement, which constrains methodological design. When a journal simultaneously serves as career currency and intellectual contribution, procedures must satisfy both functions. This often means adopting verification mechanisms that minimize risk for credential decisions even when those mechanisms poorly serve methodological learning.[^1]

With discontinuity established, the venue can optimize for methodological learning without compromise. Procedures serve verification and learning together rather than balancing competing pressures. The Reproduction Package detailed in the Appendix exemplifies this principle: the requirement that reviewers reproduce articles from disclosed prompts would prove too demanding for venues serving primarily credential functions, but becomes valuable precisely because it generates methodological insight. Scholars participating not for career advancement but for methodological development find such demands appropriate rather than excessive. The review process itself becomes a site of innovation rather than merely quality control. This ecological validity—designing procedures that function effectively in the specific environment they inhabit—enables Section 4's positive feedback loops to develop.

## 5.2 Good Faith Orientation

The self-selection mechanism created by discontinuity enables designing for willing participants rather than hostile actors. Traditional venues must defend against adversarial optimization because stakes include career advancement and institutional prestige. This generates arms races between gaming strategies and countermeasures, producing surveillance bureaucracy that burdens honest scholars while sophisticated bad actors find workarounds. As Strathern (1997) observed in analyzing British university audit systems, "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"—precisely the dynamic that credential-bearing venues cannot escape.

Discontinuity filters through transparency requirements themselves. Scholars willing to disclose complete methodological processes self-select into participation; those seeking credential shortcuts select out. This allows designing verification mechanisms that assume good faith as baseline. Verification still exists—Section 7's reproduction test provides genuine accountability—but the system trusts primarily rather than suspects universally. This orientation proves essential for Section 4's positive feedback loops. Fair review environments where participants share methodological commitment enable the iterative refinement that improves AI-assisted practices over time. Adversarial environments produce defensive concealment rather than open experimentation.

The good faith orientation does not mean naivety about human behavior. Rather, it recognizes that self-selection through costly requirements creates participant pools with different motivational distributions than venues serving credential functions. When participation requires substantial disclosure effort without credential payoff, those who participate reveal their priorities through that choice.

## 5.3 Cost Structure and Costly Signaling

The transparency requirements create an economic reality where fabricating plausible documentation proves more cognitively and temporally expensive than generating it honestly through actual scholarly work (at least, once tested, efficient, tracking procedures and devices have emerged). Inventing coherent process records that withstand reviewer scrutiny requires sophisticated deception—fabricating not just outputs but the entire developmental history. Meanwhile, scholars engaged in genuine AI-assisted work generate such documentation naturally through their actual processes. This cost differential makes honest participation the path of least resistance.

But the cost structure serves a second function beyond anti-gaming mechanics. The demanding transparency requirements operate as costly signals of methodological commitment. As Mercier (2020) argues in *Not Born Yesterday*, people assess communication for trustworthiness partly through cost considerations—costly signals prove harder to fake and thus more credible. The burden of comprehensive process documentation marks successful submissions as genuine achievements rather than casual efforts.

This connects to Section 2's core insight about prompts alone versus prompts with full process documentation. Prompts alone (component A) remain gameable; prompts combined with comprehensive process records (A+B) make fabrication more expensive than honesty while simultaneously signaling scholarly seriousness. High-quality AI-assisted work requires more effort than traditional writing or casual prompting: sustained dialogue with AI systems, conceptual precision in prompt formulation, iterative refinement across multiple exchanges. This burden filters for serious scholars while marking successful submissions as substantive contributions. Section 4 noted this raises the bar rather than lowering it—producing the opposite of "AI slop." The cost structure thus implements quality control through economic incentives while the resulting costly signals provide credible markers of genuine scholarly engagement.

## 5.4 Strategic Positioning

Discontinuity implements strategic positioning by creating the initial conditions its transformation mechanisms require. The self-selection through transparency requirements filters for methodologically committed participants, enabling the fair review environment where positive feedback loops can develop. The separation from traditional metrics provides design freedom to optimize for methodological learning rather than credential risk management. This positioning remains potentially temporary—a launch strategy for establishing norms rather than permanent separation—allowing eventual integration once quality demonstrates itself.

The subsequent sections specify how this strategic positioning translates into operational infrastructure. Section 6 details what mandatory transparency means in practice—what must be disclosed and why. Section 7 describes how the review mechanism works to ensure both accountability and methodological learning. Together, these three components create the infrastructure enabling Section 4 transformation dynamics.
