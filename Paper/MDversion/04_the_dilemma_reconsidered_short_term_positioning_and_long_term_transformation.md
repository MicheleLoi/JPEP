# 4. The Dilemma Reconsidered: Short-Term Positioning and Long-Term Transformation

Section 3 established that some scholars are motivated by wonder and philosophical necessity to engage with AI-assisted work despite professional costs. However, the final objection acknowledged that this motivation alone appears insufficient. If scholars willing to bear these costs prove rare, the proposed venue seems to choose the "ghetto" horn of Section 2's dilemma—a marginalized space disconnected from mainstream philosophical practice while the prestige economy's incentive problems persist elsewhere.

This objection assumes a static analysis: count the scholars willing to participate under current conditions, project forward linearly, and conclude the venue will remain marginal. But scholarly infrastructure does not operate in isolation. A venue's trajectory depends on feedback loops between its practices and the broader system it inhabits. What appears as marginalization under static analysis may constitute strategic positioning under dynamic analysis. The question is whether identifiable mechanisms could transform apparent marginality into eventual centrality, and whether the proposed infrastructure enables those mechanisms.

This section examines four plausible dynamics that might enable such transformation: degradation of traditional review processes, positive feedback loops within the proposed venue, external recognition from adjacent fields, and eventual prestige inversion. The analysis proceeds not as confident prediction but as hypothesis generation—identifying mechanisms that, if they operate as theorized, could shift the venue from apparent marginality to methodological centrality. Each mechanism requires empirical validation through actual implementation.

### 4.1 Traditional System Degradation

The traditional scholarly publishing system faces pressures that may accelerate independently of any alternative venue. LLM-assisted writing is already widespread but predominantly covert. As models improve and access expands, the volume of covertly AI-assisted submissions will likely increase. Traditional review processes lack mechanisms to detect this assistance reliably, creating endemic uncertainty.

This uncertainty might degrade review quality in two ways. First, reviewers may increasingly suspect AI involvement even in human-written work, particularly when arguments are well-structured or prose is polished—precisely the qualities that once marked excellent scholarship. Second, the "LLM native" generation entering academia may find traditional prohibitions incomprehensible, having learned to think with these tools and regarding restrictions on their use as arbitrary. If these dynamics unfold, the gap between official policy (minimal AI use with disclosure) and actual practice (extensive covert use) could widen.

The potential irony: transparent AI-assisted scholarship demonstrates what LLMs can contribute to philosophical work, making the capabilities more visible and suspicion more justified. Traditional venues might thus face a dilemma. They could maintain strict policies against substantial AI involvement, potentially driving honest scholars away while failing to detect covert use. Or they could liberalize policies, losing the ability to distinguish work where human contribution is substantial from work where it is minimal. Whether either option preserves the traditional review process's epistemic function remains an empirical question.

### 4.2 Positive Feedback Loops

A venue requiring full methodological disclosure could create conditions for quality improvement that traditional venues lack. When reviewers examine both articles and the prompts that generated them, they might assess not merely final products but intellectual processes. This assessment could enable targeted feedback: which prompting strategies produced insights, which led to dead ends, where human intervention was essential, where it was perfunctory.

If successful, this feedback loop might operate at three levels. Individual authors could learn from reviews what worked in their AI collaboration, improving subsequent attempts. The community might accumulate methodological knowledge as patterns emerge across multiple submissions. And AI developers could receive detailed information about how their systems perform in extended philosophical work, enabling improvements targeted at scholarly use cases rather than general metrics.

These improvements might raise the submission bar rather than lowering it. High-quality AI-assisted work plausibly requires more effort than either traditional human writing or casual AI prompting—demanding sustained dialogue, conceptual precision in prompts, and iterative refinement based on LLM outputs. The venue's standards could make AI-assisted scholarship a high-cost signal of serious methodological commitment, the opposite of "AI slop." As methodology improves, quality might increase, potentially attracting scholars who value rigor over ease.

Generational dynamics could reinforce this trajectory. Younger scholars who grew up with LLMs may regard the tools as natural extensions of thought, not external aids. They might face a choice: suppress their actual working methods to satisfy traditional norms, or develop those methods transparently in venues that welcome disclosure. The latter option could become increasingly attractive as methodological sophistication grows and career paths diversify beyond traditional tenure tracks.

### 4.3 External Recognition

Philosophical merit within philosophy departments provides one form of validation, but not the only relevant form. AI-assisted scholarly methodology could have value beyond philosophy: for social scientists studying human-AI collaboration, for computer scientists developing better language models, for researchers in any field navigating similar methodological questions. A venue producing rigorous methodological documentation might generate data of broad interdisciplinary interest.

This external recognition could create alternative citation paths. Articles might be cited not for their philosophical arguments but for their methodological contributions—how prompts were structured, how dialogue progressed, what pitfalls were encountered. The supplementary materials showing full working processes could have value independent of the arguments they produced. Philosophy journals may not cite these materials; computational linguistics journals might.

When adjacent fields recognize value that philosophy departments initially overlook, imitation cascades become possible. If historians or linguists or legal scholars develop parallel venues with similar disclosure requirements, the model could spread. What began as single philosophy journal or track might become broader movement across disciplines. At that point, resistance to the model within philosophy could become harder to sustain. The question might shift from "why would we allow this?" to "why are we falling behind?"

The external recognition need not validate philosophical arguments directly. It suffices that the methodological approach gains legitimacy. Once AI-assisted scholarship with full disclosure becomes respectable in adjacent fields, philosophy's resistance might appear parochial rather than principled. The venue's initial marginality within philosophy could become irrelevant if it achieves centrality elsewhere first.

### 4.4 Prestige Inversion

The mechanisms above could create conditions for eventual prestige inversion. Prestige flows from quality under evaluative standards a community accepts. When traditional standards fail—when covert AI use undermines review reliability, when generational divides create incomprehension—the standards may lose authority.

A venue producing demonstrably rigorous work under transparent conditions could offer what traditional venues cannot: plausible intellectual contribution. The reproduction test, supplementary materials showing full working process, and accumulated methodological knowledge might provide evidence of genuine *interactive/dialogical* scholarly work that traditional venues' opacity obscures. Transparency could shift from apparent vulnerability (exposing the AI's role) to competitive advantage (proving human contribution's substantiveness).

Prestige inversion might occur when work meeting the higher transparency standard commands more respect than work meeting only traditional standards. Disclosure could signal rigor rather than inadequacy. The venue might achieve prestige not by mimicking traditional journals but by creating parallel evaluative path that eventually supersedes them. What appeared as ghetto under static analysis could become new center under dynamic analysis.

This transformation is not inevitable. It depends on maintaining quality standards, accumulating methodological knowledge, attracting sufficient participation, and sustaining commitment to transparency. The mechanisms identified here represent testable hypotheses, not confident predictions.

### 4.5 Strategic Positioning

The four dynamics examined above—traditional system degradation, positive feedback loops, external recognition, and prestige inversion—represent plausible mechanisms rather than certain outcomes. Section 2's dilemma—choosing between contiguous assimilation that preserves perverse incentives and discontinuous marginalization that isolates—assumes these are the only stable equilibria. The dynamic analysis above suggests a third possibility: strategic positioning that accepts short-term marginality to enable potential long-term transformation. The venue would not seek validation from traditional system (avoiding assimilation's incentive problems) nor resign itself to permanent isolation (avoiding ghetto's irrelevance). Instead, it could develop parallel standards that might eventually supersede traditional ones.

Whether this resolution succeeds depends on infrastructure design. The following sections detail how explicit discontinuity (Section 5), mandatory transparency (Section 6), and reproduction-based review (Section 7) could implement the dynamic strategy outlined above. These are not separate proposals but integrated components that might enable the transformation mechanisms this section identified. The proposal's validity requires empirical testing through actual implementation and sustained assessment of outcomes.
