# 3. Why Engage with AI-Assisted Scholarship?

The structural dilemma identified in Section 2 assumed a particular anthropology of philosophical practice: scholars are motivated primarily by credential accumulation and professional advancement. Under this assumption, a venue that breaks from the traditional prestige system cannot attract serious participation. But this assumption is not exhaustive. An alternative model of philosophical practice exists, one that Plato and Aristotle identified as philosophy's origin: wonder-driven inquiry.

When Plato's Socrates identifies wonder as the beginning of philosophy (Theaetetus 155d), and when Aristotle locates the origin of philosophical investigation in experiences that provoke amazement (Metaphysics 982b12-13), they describe a response to encountering phenomena that challenge existing understanding. Many philosophers experience this response to AI capabilities—not as enthusiasm for technological novelty but as genuine perplexity about systems that appear to reason, create, and respond yet lack the characteristics we typically associate with minds.

If wonder-driven inquiry represents a legitimate model of philosophical practice, then the Section 2’s dilemma appears in different light. The venue need not choose between traditional validation (which recreates credential-seeking incentives) and marginalization (which repels all participants). Instead, it can self-select for scholars motivated by philosophical curiosity rather than professional advancement. Those engaged in wonder-driven inquiry will participate even without credential incentives, because their goal is understanding. The venue becomes viable through discontinuity with the prestige system, filtering for scholars whose motivations align with transparent methodological exploration—provided enough such scholars exist and the venue can sustain meaningful work. Whether these conditions hold depends on factors beyond motivation alone.

But recognizing wonder as motivation is insufficient. The question remains whether such wonder justifies bearing the professional costs established in Sections 2-4. Three considerations suggest it does.

## 3.1 Philosophy as Experimental Inquiry

If philosophers wonder about AI capabilities in philosophical work, Dewey's methodological standards demand more than abstract speculation. Dewey criticized philosophers for taking from science but failing to bring "deliverances of their reasoning back to the things of ordinary experience, in all their coarseness and crudity, for verification" (Dewey, 1925, pp. 34-35). Philosophy operates without complete feedback loops between theoretical claims and experiential testing. Philosophers theorize extensively about what AI systems can and cannot contribute to intellectual work—whether their outputs constitute knowledge, whether collaboration with AI undermines authentic authorship, whether these systems exhibit genuine understanding or merely mimic it. Floridi argues that AI represents agency without intelligence, systems capable of action but lacking cognition, intention, or mental states (Floridi, 2025b). In my view, even these seemingly a-priori putative truths raise questions not resolvable through pure conceptual analysis. While not amenable to empirical falsification or verification in the strict sense, views such as these gain or lose credibility through a holistic relationship with the rest of human experience, that crucially includes experience of AI capabilities, in what John Rawls (1971) called “reflective equilibrium”. Quine's naturalized epistemology makes this pragmatist methodological commitment explicit: philosophy cannot proceed independently of empirical investigation but must test its claims against experience (Quine, 1969).

Moreover, such testing cannot proceed through a few controlled experiments. The activity of philosophizing remains central to how we understand ourselves as rational, creative, and deliberative beings. Questions about whether and how AI systems can contribute to philosophical work bear on fundamental questions of human distinctiveness and intellectual autonomy. These questions cannot be settled through limited experimental trials designed to isolate variables. We must shift from the controlled experiment mindset to what Mill called "experiments of life" (Mill, 1859, Ch. III) —sustained, real-world engagement with these tools in actual philosophical practice, where the full complexity of philosophical work (not laboratory simulations of it) can be observed. Such engagement reveals possibilities and limitations that controlled experiments cannot capture, precisely because controlled experiments simplify away the features that make philosophical work what it is. According to Rawlsian philosophical liberalism (Rawls 1971), what Mill calls experiments of life, particularly when they manifest collective dimensions and contribute to public knowledge, are typically pursued in free associations when compatible with respect for other people’s basic liberties—not through state imposition but through voluntary associational structures. Free associations enable costly inquiry whose benefits extend beyond individual investigators, as the associative life around them contributes to the self-esteem of individual participants.

These considerations establish more than optional curiosity. If philosophical claims about AI capabilities require experiential testing, and if such testing demands extensive engagement rather than controlled experiments, then wonder-driven scholars pursuing these questions serve a legitimate philosophical purpose. The costs of such inquiry—time investment, professional risk, methodological uncertainty—are justified insofar as they advance philosophical understanding of consequential questions and can plausibly belong to a conception of the good some of us will find *meaningful*.

## 3.2 Creativity and Tool-Mediated Discovery

Wonder-driven experimentation with AI-assisted scholarship also reveals something about the nature of philosophical creativity itself. Consider patterns from musical composition and computer-generated art that illuminate how creative processes actually operate when mediated by technological tools.

Byrne's historical analysis of music in relation to material contexts documents a systematic divergence between how outsiders imagine creative processes and how practitioners experience them. Those unfamiliar with musical practice imagine the composer as autonomous source of creativity, with instruments and performance spaces serving as neutral tools that execute pre-formed artistic intentions. The reality, as Byrne documents through historical examples, differs substantially. Physical spaces possess acoustic properties that fundamentally shape compositional choices: CBGB's size, lack of reverberation, and noisy atmosphere shaped the kind of music Talking Heads came to write, allowing musical details to be heard while requiring high volume (Byrne, 2012, pp. 14-15). Technological constraints impose compositional limits: early vinyl records' limited data storage meant most pop songs were written to be under four minutes long, and some classical compositions incorporated decrescendos at turnover points with crescendos beginning the next side to ensure smooth listening experiences (ibid., pp. 92-93). Historical contexts shape entire musical forms: Western music performed in gothic cathedrals with long reverberation times evolved to feature modal structures with very long notes, minimizing overlap risks in that sonic environment; by the late 1700s, Mozart performed in smaller spaces with deadened sound, allowing elaborate musical details and prompting both intricate composition and larger orchestras to project over ambient noise (ibid., pp. 17-21).

Two examples from generative art and music production illustrate this pattern with particular clarity, progressing from physical analog systems to digital algorithmic processes. First, consider modular synthesis (Fig. 1). Unlike traditional instruments where the relationship between player action and sound production is relatively direct, modular synthesizers require composers to patch together separate modules—oscillators, filters, envelope generators, sequencers—using physical cables to create signal flows between components. The composer designs the system architecture, sets parameters on individual modules, and then lets the system run. The process resembles coding more than traditional musical performance: the composer structures how modules interact but does not control every waveform detail. Sonic properties emerge from the interactions between components in ways not fully predictable from individual module settings. Different patch configurations create different sonic possibilities; the system's constraints and affordances become part of musical discovery rather than obstacles to executing predetermined ideas. The composer controls the generative structure but discovers particular musical outcomes through interaction with that structure.

Second, consider computer-generated art, particularly what Boden and Edmonds term "computer-based generative art" as distinct from "computer-assisted art." In computer-assisted art, the computer functions "merely as a tool that remains under the close direction of the artist, rather like an extra paintbrush or a sharper chisel"—implementing instructions that specify the artwork's essential features (Boden & Edmonds, 2009, p. 137). Computer-based generative art operates differently: the artist establishes abstract rules implemented by a computer in ways not under direct control, such that the computer is "partly responsible for coming up with the idea itself" (ibid., p. 138). Wheeler argues this distinction separates cases where external technological elements merely implement pre-formed intentions from cases where such elements contribute to distinctively creative aspects of work (Wheeler, 2018, pp. 241-242). The artist designs the generative system—the rules, parameters, constraints—but the system produces outputs with emergent properties that weren't fully specified in the design.

These patterns illuminate AI-assisted intellectual work. Neither the modular synthesis model nor the computer-generated art model treats the technological system as transparent tool executing predetermined ideas, nor do they treat the human as passive recipient of system output. Both exhibit the generative collaboration pattern: the human agent structures the interaction, designing the system or establishing the dialogue; the system responds with outputs that have emergent properties; the agent discovers possibilities through this interaction that were not fully articulated in advance. Applied to AI-assisted philosophy, this suggests the process operates neither as simple execution (ideas fully formed in mind, AI transcribes) nor as mere endorsement (AI produces content, philosopher approves). Rather, a scholar working with an AI system may discover argumentative possibilities through dialogue that were not fully specified in initial prompts. The scholar guides and structures this exploration through prompt design and iterative refinement, but the exploration itself—the system's responses, elaborations, resistances, and redirections—contributes to philosophical outcomes in ways that weren't predetermined by either party alone. The relationship between scholars and AI systems in what Floridi terms "distant writing" instantiates this pattern of extended, tool-mediated creativity (Floridi, 2025a).

Understanding whether and how such collaboration generates genuine philosophical insight requires experiencing it, not merely theorizing about it in the abstract. Wheeler's analysis concerns musical and computer-generated art, not contemporary language models. But the conceptual framework applies: creativity operates through dynamic entanglement of internal and external processes, and understanding this requires examining actual practice rather than stipulating from armchair intuitions about what must be true of "real" creativity or "authentic" authorship.

However, this returns us to Section 2’s dilemma. If the venue attracts primarily wonder-driven scholars who value inquiry over credentials, but such scholars prove rare, the proposal appears to choose the "ghetto" horn of the dilemma—a marginalized space disconnected from mainstream philosophical practice. The recognition that some scholars are motivated by wonder does not, by itself, solve the structural problem. It merely shifts the question: are there enough such scholars to sustain a venue? And if they constitute a small minority, has the proposal simply created an honorable refuge for idealists while leaving the larger incentive structure unchanged?

The objection assumes a static picture of academic prestige and participation. It treats the initial participant base as fixed and asks whether that base suffices. But prestige hierarchies and participation patterns change over time through systemic dynamics. A venue that appears marginal at inception may not remain marginal if it generates consequences that transform the surrounding landscape. The question is not whether enough wonder-driven scholars exist now, but whether the infrastructure enables dynamics that could shift incentives, practices, and evaluative standards more broadly. That possibility depends on specific features of the proposed venue and their interaction with trends already underway in academic publishing. Section 4 examines these dynamics.
