## **4.7.6 Discovery and Formalization of Type 2b / Type 8b**

**Meta Note:** the final definition of the artifact ontology progressed in two steps, across different conversations:

1.  **October 19 approach** (while developing Section 7 guidance): EXPANSION via subtypes - Introduced "Type 2b (Section-Level Prompt Development Logs)" as new category to accommodate section guidance development materials. Strategy was to expand Type 2 with subtypes (2a, 2b...) to handle different kinds of materials. Context was specific section work (Section 7). It was included as input in a chat that developed the *later approach* (2)

2.  **Later approach** (while working on Appendix A documentation structure): RECONCEPTUALIZATION via functional distinction - Moved away from Type 2 subtypes entirely. Realized the distinction wasn't between subtypes of Type 2, but between Type 2 (verbatim exploratory dialogue regardless of purpose) and Type 8 (structured documentation ending in prompts regardless of which prompt). The principle "if it ended in a prompt, it's prompt development" collapsed the subtype expansion into a cleaner functional split. Context was meta-level documentation work (Appendix A). This represented moving from category proliferation (adding 2a, 2b, 2c...) to principled distinction (format and function determine type)

3.  **To be explained .**This delivers the final “canonical description” of the artifacts used as input in other chats:

    1.  Asking Claude to classify the chat content based on the canonical descriptions, producing the appropriate documentation artifacts for that chat as a result

    2.  Asking Claude to test the validity of the distinction, by applying it to the case at hand
