## **4.7.2 Original text conversation on how to make the paper visible and useful for different stakeholders**

> **Model(s):** OpenAI GPT-5 Thinking  
> **Usage window:** Q3–Q4 2025 (finalized Oct 13, 2025)  
> **Context:** Discussion on non-design logistics (submission mechanics, SEO, hosting, etc.) is elided since irrelevant to  paper writing. What was relevant was the idea of what different stakeholders could learn from the documentation of a LLM-assisted writing process. Headings and formatting in the original.

> **Notes:** Text redacted by the LLM model, with verbatim excerpts. Only the segment relevant to model documentation is retained.

> **ChatGPT ha detto:**

> Thought for 24s
>
> Short answer: for a **vision paper**, the protocol doesn’t need to ship code or a full toolkit—but it **does** need to be *operationalizable and testable*. Think in terms of a **spec, not an implementation**: clear conformance levels, required artifacts, and a reviewer checklist that lets someone decide “eligible / ineligible” without guessing.
>
> Below is a pragmatic way to pitch the transparency protocol now, while leaving room for a later, collective build-out.
>
> **What “technical enough” looks like (for a vision paper)**
>
> **Define conformance levels (so it’s not all-or-nothing)**
>
> Use MUST/SHOULD/MAY language and make each level auditable.
>
> **Level 0 — Disclosure** *(baseline eligibility)*
>
> MUST state model(s) and provider(s) used; **version/date window**; **temperature/top-p** (or defaults); prompt categories used (system, user, tool calls).
>
> MUST provide a **provenance statement**: where LLM outputs appear (structuring, drafting, paraphrase).
>
> MUST provide a **data & assistance statement**: what external tools/files/plugins were used.
>
> **Level 1 — Reconstructible**
>
> MUST include a **minimal prompt log** (system + representative user prompts), **parameter settings**, and **human-edit provenance** (e.g., tracked changes or diff summaries by section).
>
> SHOULD include **time-stamped session slices** (enough to see iteration, not necessarily every keystroke).
>
> SHOULD include **source material list** with stable identifiers (DOIs/URLs/hashes).
>
> **Level 2 — Verifiable**
>
> MUST provide **rerun instructions** sufficient for a competent reviewer to regenerate *similar* outputs (allowing non-determinism).
>
> MUST provide **artifact hashes** (of prompts, source packs) and a **claim ↔ evidence table** mapping key argumentative steps to LLM/human contributions.
>
> SHOULD include **control runs** (e.g., same prompts with temperature=0, or alternative model).
>
> **Level 3 — Replicable** *(target for the venue, not required now)*
>
> MUST provide **full interaction logs** (with redactions policy), **environment capture** (model build, API version), and **seed management** for determinism where feasible.
>
> SHOULD provide a **sealed archive** (e.g., hashed bundle deposited with a third party) plus a **release plan** on acceptance.
>
> Your paper can say: *this submission meets Level 0–1 now; the proposed venue aims for Level 2 minimum, Level 3 encouraged.*
>
> **Specify the artifact bundle (what a submission must carry)**
>
> No code required—just name the objects precisely.
>
> **T-1. Model metadata sheet:** model name, provider, version/channel, date range of use, safety mode/filters, key params.
>
> **T-2. Prompt pack:** system prompt(s), representative user prompts per section, and any tool/plugin invocations.
>
> **T-3. Edit provenance:** either a tracked-changes PDF/Docx diff or a section-level “edit ledger” (what changed, why, human vs LLM).
>
> **T-4. Source pack manifest:** canonical citations, plus hashes of any local files fed to the model.
>
> **T-5. Evidence table:** rows = argumentative claims; cols = (human/LLM role, prompt ref, output ref, sources).
>
> **T-6. Redaction log (if applicable):** what’s withheld, why (privacy/contract/IP), and how replication is still possible.
>
> These are **names and schemas**, not software.
>
> **Include a reviewer checklist (so eligibility is decidable)**
>
> One page, binary boxes. Example:
>
> □ Model/version/time window declared
>
> □ Parameters declared or stated “default”
>
> □ Minimal prompt log present
>
> □ Human/LLM roles per section stated
>
> □ Evidence table links claims → artifacts
>
> □ Redactions justified; replication path provided
>
> □ Rerun instructions (Level 2+) present
>
> If a submission fails boxes 1–4 → **ineligible** (desk reject for the proposed venue). This keeps burden on authors, not reviewers.
>
> **Commit to a two-phase disclosure (fits your situation now)**
>
> **Phase A (preprint):** Levels 0–1 + partial logs sufficient for reconstruction; deposit a **commitment hash** of the full archive (you can produce it later without having revealed it now).
>
> **Phase B (post-acceptance or journal publication):** release the fuller bundle (toward Level 2/3).  
> This addresses privacy/IP and your plan to add materials at journal stage.
>
> **Define redaction rules up front (prevents “gotcha” objections)**
>
> Allowed: removal of personal data, third-party proprietary text, and sensitive prompts—**but** require a **substitute stub** (type, length, function) and **impact statement** on replicability.
>
> Require **hashes of redacted items** so later disclosure can be verified against the commitment.
>
> **Bound what the protocol is *not* (to avoid category errors)**
>
> Not mandating open-sourcing models or private corpora.
>
> Not guaranteeing bit-identical outputs (acknowledge stochasticity).
>
> Not ethical approval by itself; it’s a **precondition** for reviewability
>
> **Why this level is sufficient for now (and persuasive)**
>
> **Academics**: They can judge *method, not vibes*. Levels + artifacts + checklist = a spec they can argue with and extend.
>
> **NGO/policy skeptics**: The hinge is transparency and auditability; the protocol makes falsifiability and accountability concrete without requiring risky data dumps.
>
> **Business**: Clear knobs to turn (disclosure policy, artifact retention, internal review), minimal operational burden at Level 1, room to grow to Level 2 for high-stakes work.
>
> **Common pushbacks you’ll get—and how this structure answers them**
>
> **“Too vague to audit.”** → Levels + checklist + evidence table = auditable now, even without a toolkit.
>
> **“Will be gamed.”** → Redaction log + hashes + commitment scheme + control runs reduce easy gaming and create consequences at acceptance.
>
> **“Reviewer burden explodes.”** → Desk-eligibility boxes front-load author work; evidence table centralizes where to look.
>
> **“Non-determinism breaks replication.”** → You promise *reconstruction & verification*, not byte equality; seeds and parameter disclosure where feasible.
>
> **“Privacy/IP conflicts.”** → Preprint/journal two-phase disclosure; redaction rules with replication alternatives.
>
> **What to include in *this* paper (vision-level, crisp)**
>
> A one-page **Conformance Table** (Levels 0–3 with MUST/SHOULD).
>
> A two-page **Artifacts Appendix** (T-1…T-6 with 1–2 sentence definitions).
>
> A one-page **Reviewer Checklist** (binary boxes).
>
> A paragraph on **Two-phase disclosure & commitment hash**.
>
> A paragraph on **Redaction policy**.
>
> A short **Self-conformance statement**: “This paper meets Level 1 (items …); upon journal submission we will release … toward Level 2.”
>
> That’s *technical enough* to be actionable and reviewable, while still clearly a **vision + requirements** piece that invites a broader, collective implementation effort later.
>
> **\[Human said\]:**
>
> What would less than that achieve? I doubt the viability of such technical precision, I am more for a gradual approach, the level of transparency now is close to zero. And my focus is on writing techniques , including for enhancing reliability, not software verification
>
> **ChatGPT said:**
>
> Thought for 25s
>
> You can go **much** lighter than a spec—and still get real benefits—if you treat “transparency” as a **writing discipline** rather than a software protocol.
>
> Here’s what a **gradual, writing-centric** approach buys you (and what it can’t):
>
> **What “less technical” *does* achieve**
>
> **Sets a social norm** readers/reviewers can reward: “this author is not hiding the ball.”
>
> **Gives reviewers a handle** to argue with the paper on method (not vibes).
>
> **Creates a floor** that deters the worst misuse (quiet prompt-stuffing, unattributed LLM drafting).
>
> **Is adoptable now** by ordinary authors (no tools, no logs), so it can spread.
>
> **What it *won’t* do**
>
> Guarantee replication or auditability in the strong sense.
>
> Prevent motivated gaming.
>
> Eliminate reviewer workload or ambiguity on edge cases.
>
> **The “minimal viable transparency” (writer’s version)**
>
> Use these as **appendix items** or sidebars—not a toolkit.
>
> **Role map (1/3 page)  **
> A tiny table listing for each section (Abstract, Intro, §2, …): *Human-led* / *LLM-assisted* / *LLM-drafted then edited*, plus a one-line note if LLM shaped structure or phrasing.
>
> **Prompt exemplars (½ page max)  **
> Not logs—just **2–4 representative prompts** (system/user) that illustrate how you used the model for this paper. If parameters varied wildly, say “defaults; exploratory.”
>
> **Edit-provenance summary (10 lines)  **
> Narrative bullets like: “§3 first draft by LLM; author rewrote for claims A–C; all citations human-curated; figures entirely human.” If you have a tracked-changes snapshot for one key passage, include 1 image.
>
> **Claim→evidence map (1 table)  **
> 5–10 major claims only. Columns: *Claim*, *Evidence/source(s)*, *LLM role* (suggestion/draft/paraphrase/none), *Human check performed* (fact-check, paraphrase-against-source, counter-argument test).
>
> **Quality passes (checkboxes, 8–10 lines)**
>
> □ Paraphrase-against-source for all quoted/paraphrased material
>
> □ Counter-argument pass (generated or human) considered in §…
>
> □ Factual spot-check on named facts (list 3–5)
>
> □ Style normalization to avoid “model voice”
>
> □ Uncertainty/limitations paragraph included
>
> **Redaction note (2–3 lines, if relevant)  **
> “Some interactions withheld (privacy/IP). Substantive prompts exemplified above; withheld items are of the same type.”
>
> That’s it. No seeds, no hashes, no environment capture—just **writerly artifacts** a reviewer can read in five minutes.
>
> **How this helps each audience**
>
> **Academics:** gives them *objects to review* (role map, claim table) without demanding tooling. A critic can point to row 4 rather than allege “AI slop.”
>
> **NGO skeptics:** centers **disclosure and accountability** (what was human vs. model), which matches their governance lens.
>
> **Business:** translates immediately into **policyable practice** (a checklist their teams can adopt). That’s consulting fuel without software verification.
>
> **If you want even *less* (the absolute floor)**
>
> A **Disclosure paragraph** (models used, general roles), **one prompt exemplar**, **one claim-evidence table**, and **the quality-pass checklist**.
>
> This already moves the field from “near zero” to “non-zero and discussable.”
>
> **Why not jump to full precision (now)?**
>
> Because norms beat tooling at this stage. If **10% of papers** carry the six items above, reviewers and editors will start **asking for them**, and you’ve shifted incentives. Your later venue can then ratchet from this floor to stricter tiers.
>
> **How to present it in a *vision* paper (without pretending it’s more)**
>
> Call it **“Transparency Note (v0.1)”** and state plainly: requirements are **operational**; implementation is **illustrative**; stronger verification is a **future venue goal**.
>
> Include a **self-conformance sentence**: “This paper provides a role map, prompt exemplars, a claim→evidence table, and a quality-pass checklist; fuller interaction tracking is deferred to journal submission.”
>
> **Likely outcomes of this lighter approach**
>
> **You gain legitimacy now** (clear, inspectable habits) without over-promising.
>
> **Debate localizes** to concrete artifacts (“your Claim 3 lacks human check”), which is exactly what you want.
>
> **Business readers see a path** they can adopt next quarter (“we’ll require a role map + claim table in internal memos”).
>
> If later the community wants more rigor, you’ve laid a **clean upgrade path**: expand the claim table, add a few more exemplars, then—only when there’s demand—graduate to partial logs.
>
> **Verbatim dialogue excerpt (design/protocol only)**

> **Human:**
>
> Would providing the model, but not time signal, be of any utility? Consider that reproducibility consists in a test to be done on the same or a different model of the same level of advancement
>
> **Chat GPT:**
>
> Short answer: **naming the model without a time signal is somewhat useful—but only for interpretation, not for even “weakened” reproducibility.** If you won’t include time, you should add a *capability anchor* so others can match “same level of advancement.”
>
> **What you gain without time**
>
> Readers can **interpret** style/behavior (e.g., Claude vs GPT family).
>
> Reviewers can judge **method fit** (why you used this model, how you used it).
>
> **What you lose without time**
>
> **Silent updates** change a model under the same name; “same model” weeks later may behave differently.
>
> “**Same level of advancement**” is undefined without an anchor; replicators can over- or under-shoot.
>
> **How to compensate (if you omit time)**
>
> Add one of these *lightweight, writer-centric* anchors in your v0.1 note:
>
> **Capability anchor (probe battery) — recommended  **
> Include a tiny, public “probe set” (5–8 short items) and your observed outputs/scores. Replicators use the same probes to pick a model whose behavior is *within tolerance*.
>
> Examples of probes (keep generic):
>
> a short chain-of-thought redaction task (report only final answers),
>
> a structured citation check (can it keep source/claim alignment?),
>
> a compressed argument reconstruction (can it preserve premises/conclusion under paraphrase?),
>
> a counter-argument generation sanity check (does it surface nontrivial objections?).
>
> In your appendix: list the probes, your outputs/ratings, and an acceptance band (e.g., “match ≥N/8 items or qualitatively similar failure modes”).
>
> **Model “channel” + config  **
> If you can’t give dates, at least state **family + channel/variant** (e.g., “Sonnet vs Opus”; “preview vs stable/lts”), and the **key params** you used (temperature/top-p/max_tokens). That narrows variance a bit.
>
> **Comparative replication clause  **
> Add a line: “Reproduction may use a different model **of comparable capability**, as evidenced by meeting the probe battery tolerance above.” This codifies your “same level of advancement” idea.
>
> **Minimal template you can drop into the v0.1 note**
>
> **Model family:** \<provider + model name\>.
>
> **Config:** temperature=\<…\>, top_p=\<…\>, max_tokens=\<…\>, tools=\<…\>.
>
> **Time:** *not disclosed*.
>
> **Capability anchor:** “See App. B (8-item probe battery) and Table B1 (our outputs/ratings). Replications should use any model whose probe results fall within the acceptance band stated in App. B.”
>
> **Comparative replication:** “Either the named model or any model meeting the probe band is acceptable; divergences should be noted.”
>
> **Practical outcomes**
>
> **Academics/NGOs:** They can still evaluate your **method** and **disclosure discipline**, and they have a concrete way to judge “same level.”
>
> **Replicators:** They won’t get bit-level reproduction, but they can **functionally** test your claims on a roughly equivalent model.
>
> **You:** You avoid timestamping while keeping the protocol **operationalizable**.
>
> **If you’re willing to add *some* time without precision**
>
> A coarse bucket (“interactions occurred in **Q3 2025**”) dramatically improves interpretability and doesn’t pin you to exact dates. It’s a very low-cost upgrade over “no time.”
>
> **Bottom line:** “Model-only” is better than nothing, but weak for reproducibility. Pair it with a **small probe battery** (capability anchor) and a **comparative replication clause** to make your “same level of advancement” idea concrete, even without a time signal.
>
> **Human:** This should be maximally accessible to enhance usability by non tech oriented writers at least initially, inclusion more important than detail, do you think config parameters are easy? I don't think so. Perhaps just leave model family, model name and date ranges of the entire set (no need to precisely date all artifacts used over time, just giving an indication of state of advancement at the time)
>
> **Chat GPT:** I agree: if you want **maximal accessibility for non-technical writers**, drop config params for now. A **model family + model name + coarse date window** is enough to set expectations and keep things inclusive. You can tighten later.
>
> Here’s a **v0.1-Light** transparency note you can copy/paste (no tech fields):
>
> **Transparency Note (v0.1-Light)**
>
> **Model(s):** ☐ Provider + family + name (e.g., Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet; OpenAI o3)  
> **Usage window:** ☐ Broad date range (e.g., “May–Aug 2025” or “Q3 2025”)  
> **Roles by section:** ☐ Mark each section as Human-led / LLM-assisted / LLM-drafted-then-edited  
> **Prompt exemplars:** ☐ 2–4 short, representative prompts (no logs, no parameters)  
> **Edit provenance (10 lines max):** ☐ What the model drafted vs. what you rewrote; how citations were handled  
> **Claim↔Evidence table (5–10 rows):** ☐ Key claims, sources, LLM role, human checks performed  
> **Quality checks (tick boxes):** ☐ paraphrase-against-source ☐ counter-argument pass ☐ spot-check facts ☐ limitations paragraph  
> **Redaction note (if any):** ☐ What type of content is withheld and why; how a reader can still follow/assess the argument
>
> **Why this is enough (for now)**
>
> **Interpretability:** readers know *what* you used and roughly *when* (mitigates silent model updates).
>
> **Accountability:** clear human/LLM role boundaries + concrete exemplars + claim table.
>
> **Adoptability:** no API settings, no seeds, no tooling—any writer can do it.
>
> **What you give up (acceptable trade-off)**
>
> **Strict replication:** without params/timestamps per artifact, results aren’t rerunnable.
>
> **Fine-grained comparability:** future runs may differ.  
> You can say this explicitly: *“This is a vision paper; we prioritize inclusive disclosure over technical re-execution. Later versions may include optional technical fields.”*
