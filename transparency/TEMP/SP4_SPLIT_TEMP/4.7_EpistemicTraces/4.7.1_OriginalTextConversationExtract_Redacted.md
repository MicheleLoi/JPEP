## **4.7.1:** Original Text Conversation Extract (Redacted) 

> Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 
>
> Usage window: Q3–Q4 2025 (finalized Oct 10, 2025)
>
> Context: this started as a conversation on creating the journal, including practical aspects, names of potential associates etc, role of the author etc.  Text redacted by LLM model, with verbatim excerpts.Only dialogue pertaining to theoretical paper on justification remains.**  
> PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION**
>
> **Core Question:** If an argument is developed through AI-assisted dialogue and posted online with full disclosure, what must "Scholar B" do to publish it in academic journals while remaining compliant?
>
> **Options Identified:**
>
> Cite and build - Scholar B writes their own paper citing your work (fully compliant)
>
> Complete reformulation - Scholar B rewrites entirely in their own voice (ambiguous - is this plagiarism of the argument?)
>
> Co-authorship - You and Scholar B collaborate, with proper disclosure (probably compliant)
>
> Attribution without authorship - Scholar B rewrites, acknowledges your argument in footnotes (the grey zone)
>
> **Current barriers prevent:** The argument as collaboratively produced from entering formal venues. It must be "laundered" through substantial human rewriting.
>
> **INCENTIVES ANALYSIS**
>
> **Author:** No I'm thinking about whether honesty in reporting involvement is affected for people who actually think their paper may become prestigious
>
> **LLM:** Excellent point. This creates a perverse gradient:
>
> For papers you think will be important/prestigious:
>
> Maximum incentive to underreport AI involvement
>
> The disclosure becomes permanently attached to a high-value career asset
>
> "This might define my career, so I definitely can't mark it as AI-assisted"
>
> For papers you think are minor/forgettable:
>
> Lower cost to disclose honestly
>
> "It's just another paper, who cares"
>
> Result: The most important work has the strongest incentives for dishonesty. Exactly where we'd most want transparency, we get the least.
>
> **Author:** The problem I see that as long as this is seen as contiguous with the established prestige system, people may even submit a great paper with substantial under reporting just in case it becomes their defining paper. Not a radical dishonesty but playing down the percentage
>
> **Assistant:** Exactly. This is the fatal flaw in the current framing.
>
> If we position this venue as:
>
> "Work published here might get cited in prestigious journals"
>
> "Could become part of the traditional scholarly record"
>
> "After 2-3 years, we'll see if it gets recognized"
>
> Then authors face the SAME incentives to underreport, even here. Because:
>
> "What if this becomes my most-cited paper?"
>
> "I should say 30% AI involvement, not 70%, just in case"
>
> "The disclosure is permanent and attached to my career-defining work"
>
> We haven't created safe space for honesty. We've just created another venue where the prestige economy's norms still operate.
>
> The fundamental tension:
>
> If this venue seeks validation from traditional system → traditional norms reassert themselves
>
> If this venue explicitly breaks from traditional system → becomes ghetto, authors don't care enough to be honest anyway
>
> **SOLUTION: DISCONTINUITY + MANDATORY DISCLOSURE**
>
> **Human:** I'm thinking about two things not mutually exclusive: signal more discontinuity with existing prestige network, mandatory disclose of prompting upon acceptance (has significant positive externalities)
>
> **Assistant:** This is much stronger. Two concrete moves:
>
> Signal Discontinuity
>
> Stop pretending this will eventually be validated by traditional metrics. Make clear this is a different game:
>
> Explicitly not seeking indexing in traditional databases (initially)
>
> Not designed to "count" for tenure/promotion
>
> Different editorial values: process transparency matters as much as argument quality
>
> For scholars who value methodological contribution over credential accumulation
>
> You're opting out of the prestige competition, not trying to win it differently
>
> Mandatory Prompt Disclosure Upon Acceptance
>
> Timing is key: Authors submit paper. IF accepted, THEN they must provide:
>
> Full prompts (or representative sample)
>
> Dialogue transcripts showing key argument development
>
> Reflection on what worked/didn't work in the collaboration
>
> Why this changes everything:
>
> Eliminates post-hoc minimizing: Can't say "30% AI" in submission then discover the paper becomes prestigious. The detailed disclosure comes AFTER you've committed.
>
> Creates positive externality: The prompt transcripts become a methodological dataset. Other scholars learn "here's how good AI-assisted philosophy actually works." Huge value to research community.
>
> Self-selects for honesty: Only people genuinely comfortable with full transparency will submit. Solves the underreporting problem through selection, not monitoring.
>
> Makes transparency the contribution: The disclosure isn't embarrassing footnote—it's scholarly contribution. You're teaching others your methodology.
>
> Reframes the venue's purpose: Not "here's where AI-assisted papers hide," but "here's where we openly share how to do AI-assisted scholarship well."
>
> **META-STRATEGY AND REVIEW MECHANISM**
>
> **Human:** Write a summary of the project idea so far. It will be used for a paper given this strategy: Try to publish the argument that such journal is needed. Using the method of writing for this paper. The paper methodology will clarify the substantial role of the LLM in the paper itself, the hypothesis that editors will find it impossible to give a fair chance of review will be made (two reasons, some reviewers will react badly af being sent what they regard as ai slop, some reviewers will be wary of alienating reviewers for this reasons) The methodology will be a model for what the paper submission must contain Revised idea about the reviewing mechanism: A. Prompt submitted together with paper B. Reviewer A reviews paper without prompt B reviews prompt without paper for two reasons: inherent interesting aspects of the prompt (prompt intrinsic scientific quality) and robustness C. Robustness tested in the following way: reviewer B reproduces the procedure with a state of art LLM, than grades it (pass fail) producing a standard review of the paper content and quality Editor checks the coherence between the two reviews D editor assesses whether
