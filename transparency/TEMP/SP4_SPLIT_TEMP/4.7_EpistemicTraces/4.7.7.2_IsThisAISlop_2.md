**Prompt context (one line)**

Author asks how their manuscript would fare in peer review; Chat GPT 5 Thinking gives an initial **verdict** (“major revision plausible / desk-reject risk”), and the dialogue co-shapes a **pilot plan** (vision/PoC framing, dual-review with trajectory-matching, author-vs-reviewer guidance, ~1-hour basic check, SP-1–SP-5 + Reproduction Guide).

**Verbatim excerpts about the pilot idea**

**Author**

assess this paper The Journal of Prompt-Engineered Philosophy: An Experiment in Methodologically Transparent Scholarship

**Chat GPT 5 Thinking**

Short answer: **yes—“major revision” is a very plausible referee verdict**, *if* the paper reaches external review… at many generalist philosophy journals it’s more likely to be **desk-rejected for scope/fit**…

**Author**

isn't there a chance for a minor review? does the paper make the case that this is meant to outline a vision, and merely provide a "proof of concept", clearly enough? and is that a sufficient defence for turning this into a more "scientific" empirical paper

**Chat GPT 5 Thinking**

there’s **some** chance of a minor revision—but only in a well-matched venue (methods-friendly/special issue) **and** if you frame the piece explicitly as a **vision + proof-of-concept (PoC)** with tightly bounded claims.

**Author**

where in the paper are the vision + proof of concepts necessary

**Chat GPT 5 Thinking**

Add small, high-signal elements that pre-empt “please add a whole pilot”: … **Operational Rubric (1 page)** — **Pass criteria**… **Inter-rater plan**… **Time targets**… **Failure modes**.

**Author**

we don't modify how to assess it. Just briefly say here what would be necessary to assess (to pre-empt the objection). There is no governance addendum; find the right characterization of what the appendix offers, using its current language

**Chat GPT 5 Thinking**

Put the genre/scope signaling in the **abstract**… “This is a **design/vision paper with a proof-of-concept**… We do **not** report outcomes; a proper assessment would require only a small pilot with predeclared criteria…”

**Author**

you should distinguish what to write in 6 (author perspective) and what in 7 (reviewer perspective). And the paragraph should be a bit longer, you can't append a short paragraph like that

**Chat GPT 5 Thinking**

**Reviewer-side use in a small pilot (proof-of-concept).** … the **basic sufficiency test**—determining whether the main argumentative steps can be reproduced from the documented inputs—**should be possible in about one hour** … the duration of **further checks** … is **variable** … provide a **first step** that the community can **improve by trial and error** … **Appendix A (SP-1–SP-5; Reproduction Guide)**.

**Author**

6 does not talk about reproduction text, focuses on how an author can track its use for documentation  
7 focuses only on reproduction and is talking to the reviewer identifying himself like a potential reviewer

**Chat GPT 5 Thinking**

Practically, you would (i) load the author’s **SP-1 (Complete Prompt)** as your primary input, (ii) consult the **SP-2 (Reproduction Package)** together with the **SP-3 (Reproduction Guide)** for section-by-section cues, and (iii) attempt a comparison draft that exhibits the same key moves and overall structure.
