# 5.2.4. Prompt Development Log: Appendix A Guidance (Initial Development)

**Document Type:** Type 8 - Prompt Development Log (Section-Level)  
**Section:** Appendix A - Documentation Structure and Reproduction Procedure  
**Date Created:** October 13, 2025  
**Date Reconstructed:** January 2, 2026  
**Status:** Complete  
**Source Chat:** JPEP section (8/9 preliminary chat c'ed (attention window exhaustion prevention))  
**Source Chat ID:** fb6251ae-9ce3-4e5e-8b3f-4ef67aa42092  
**Final Output:** Section Guidance 4.4.4 (Appendix A portion)  
**Input to:** 4.7.6.2 (via 4.4.4)

## Scope and Context

This log documents the initial development of Appendix A guidance within the broader Sections 8-9 and Appendix session. The guidance established the artifact ontology that would later be refined in subsequent development work.

## Development Process

### PDL-001: Ontology Establishment

**Issue:** Need to establish document type system for Appendix A to explain

**Initial Categories Identified:**
- Epistemic Trace (Type 1)
- Prompt Development Log (Type 2) 
- Complete Prompt (Type 3)
- Section Guidance (Type 4)
- Modification Log (Type 5)
- Pattern Summary (Type 6)
- Section Summary (Type 7)
- Reference Log (Type 8)
- Reproduction Package (Type 9)
- Reproduction Guide (Type 10)
- Notes (Type 11)

**Decision:** Establish 11 document types as the ontological framework Appendix A must explain

**Rationale:** Provides systematic categorization of all process documentation artifacts

### PDL-002: Anti-Proliferation Principle

**User Correction:** "there is something you don't understand: [...] Section summary is not an existing category, so it should never be mentioned. There is a prohibition to add entities or categories."

**Recognition:** Cannot create new document types without explicit justification

**Resolution:**
- Enforce strict adherence to 11 established types
- Any proposed categorization must use existing types
- Guidance must prevent category proliferation during writing

**Impact:** Established constraint that would shape all subsequent ontology work

### PDL-003: Terminology Standardization

**Issue:** Inconsistent terminology across guidance ("special sauce," "Level 2 MODs," etc.)

**User Requirement:** Standardize all terminology

**Changes Implemented:**
- "X artifact" → Reproduction Package
- "Special sauce" → Reproduction Package  
- "Level 2 MODs" → Modification Logs
- "Level 3 MODs" → Pattern Summaries
- "Additional Session Prompt" → Section Guidance

**Rationale:** Clear, consistent terminology enables precise communication and prevents confusion

### PDL-004: Key Terminology Section

**Addition:** Created explicit "Key Terminology" section in guidance listing:
- All 11 document types with brief descriptions
- Supplementary file structure (SP-1 through SP-5)
- Deprecated terminology to avoid

**Purpose:** Provides reference for writer to maintain consistent usage

**Note:** This terminology section became input to later ontology refinement work (4.7.6.2)

### PDL-005: Three-Tier Structure

**Structure Established:**
- **Section 8 (main body):** Conceptual level, ~1,200-1,500 words
- **Appendix A:** Detailed but conceptual, ~3,000-4,000 words  
- **Supplementary materials:** Actual artifacts

**Appendix A Required Content:**
- A.3: Define all 11 document types
- A.4: Explain 5-file supplementary structure (SP-1 through SP-5)
- A.5: Guide to using materials for Reviewer B

**Rationale:** Appropriate abstraction levels for different audiences

### PDL-006: Proof-of-Concept Framing

**Principle Established:** Appendix must be "detailed but still conceptual, NOT prescriptive"

**Key Language:**
- "This paper demonstrates..." (not "papers must...")
- "Proof-of-concept" status acknowledged
- "Future work will refine..." orientation

**Rationale:** Maintains experimental stance consistent with paper's overall framing

## Final Output: Section Guidance 4.4.4

**Structure:**
- Purpose statement
- Target length (~3,000-4,000 words)
- Required sections (A.1 through A.5 minimum)
- Critical requirement: A.3 must define all 11 types
- Critical requirement: A.4 must explain 5-file structure
- Success criteria
- **Key Terminology section** (embedded taxonomy with old numbering)

**Critical Feature:** Embedded complete listing of 11 document types that became input for later refinement

## Development Lessons

**Key insights from this process:**

1. **Ontological discipline required:** Cannot add categories without justification
2. **Terminology standardization essential:** Prevents confusion across sections
3. **Embedded taxonomy becomes input:** Key Terminology section provided foundation for later refinement
4. **Three-tier abstraction works:** Main text/Appendix/Supplementary division maintains appropriate detail levels
5. **Proof-of-concept framing crucial:** Prevents overprescriptive tone

## Summary

**What was established:**
- 11 document type ontology (with old numbering)
- Anti-proliferation constraint  
- Standardized terminology
- Three-tier structure (Section 8/Appendix/Supplementary)
- Proof-of-concept framing

**What was produced:**
- Section Guidance 4.4.4 with embedded taxonomy
- Clear requirements for Appendix A writing
- Foundation for later ontology refinement

**Status:** Initial guidance complete; became input to subsequent ontology development (4.7.6.2 via embedded taxonomy in 4.4.4)

**Relationship to later work:** This guidance's Key Terminology section (containing the 11 types with old numbering) was used as input for the ontology clarification and renumbering documented in 4.7.6.2
