## VERIFICATION NEEDED

### From Wheeler's Bibliography
The following sources are cited via Wheeler. Need to verify exact citations match Wheeler's reference list:

1. **Boden & Edmonds (2009)** - Is this the correct citation Wheeler uses?
2. **Clark (2008)** - Is this the correct citation Wheeler uses for "cognitive niche construction"?

**Action:** Check Wheeler (2018) reference list to confirm these citations.

### Wheeler Page Numbers
Current citations use Kindle section locations. User will convert to page numbers from Gaut & Kieran (2018) volume in final Word file.

---

## CITATION NOTES

### Daily Nous Sources
Limited use - teaching-focused, paper brackets teaching/learning issues:
- Jollimore (2025)
- Rini (2025)  
- Berg & Robbins (2024)
- Ontiveros & Clay (2021)

These establish debate framing in Introduction but are not central to argument.

### Floridi Citations
Two distinct works:
- **(2025a)** "Distant Writing" - concept of AI-mediated literary production
- **(2025b)** "AI as Agency without Intelligence" - Multiple Realisability of Agency thesis

Both used substantively in Section V.

### Wheeler and Secondary Sources
Wheeler (2018) analyzes Byrne's observations philosophically. When citing:
- **Byrne's observations** (CBGB, vinyl, cathedrals) → cite Byrne (2012) directly
- **Wheeler's analysis** (inside-and-outside logic, philosophical framework) → cite Wheeler (2018)
- **Boden & Edmonds, Clark** → cited via Wheeler with acknowledgment

### Classical Sources
Standard references by passage:
- Plato, *Theaetetus* 155d
- Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 982b12-13

No page numbers needed; cited by standard textual divisions.

---

## REFERENCES REMOVED FROM EARLIER VERSIONS

The following were in preliminary reference lists but cut as unnecessary:

- **Byrne references:** Initially considered for removal as "too far from philosophy" but reinstated and cited extensively
- **James, W.** *Pragmatism* - Removed, not needed for final argument
- **Quine, W.V.O.** "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" - Removed, "Epistemology Naturalized" more relevant

---

## STYLE NOTES

### Citation Format in Text
**In-text citations:**
- (Author, Year) for paraphrases
- (Author, Year, pp. X-Y) for specific passages
- Classical sources by standard reference (Theaetetus 155d)

**Footnotes:**
- Substantive clarifications
- Secondary citations (via Wheeler)
- Technical details that would interrupt flow

### Bibliography Format
Following standard philosophy journal format:
- Author. (Year). "Title." *Journal/Book*, Volume(Issue), pages. [DOI/URL where applicable]
- Classical sources by standard reference without year
