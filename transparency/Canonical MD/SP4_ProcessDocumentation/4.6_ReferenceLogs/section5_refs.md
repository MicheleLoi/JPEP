## Need to Add/Verify

### Mill on "Experiments of Life"
**STATUS:** NEEDS EXACT CITATION

The phrase "experiments of life" appears in Mill's work, likely in *On Liberty* or *A System of Logic*. Most probable source:

**Mill, J. S. (1859).** *On Liberty*. Chapter III: "Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being."

The passage discusses different "experiments of living" and how society benefits from diversity of life choices. Need to verify:
1. Exact page reference in standard edition
2. Whether phrase is "experiments of life" or "experiments of living"
3. Context - is it about intellectual inquiry or life choices generally?

**ACTION NEEDED:** Verify Mill source before finalizing paper.

**If Mill reference cannot be verified:** Either:
- Find correct source for the concept (it's definitely Mill's idea)
- Remove attribution and just describe the concept
- Use different Mill work that makes similar point

### Quine - Naturalized Epistemology
**STATUS:** MENTIONED BUT NOT CITED

Current text says: "Quine's naturalized epistemology makes this methodological commitment explicit."

**Need to add:**
- **Quine, W. V. O. (1969).** "Epistemology Naturalized." In *Ontological Relativity and Other Essays*. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 69-90.

This is the canonical source for naturalized epistemology and rejection of analytic/synthetic distinction in epistemology specifically.

## References Removed from Earlier Draft

### Successfully Cut
- **Byrne, D. (2012).** *How Music Works*. - TOO DISTANT FROM PHILOSOPHY
- **James, W.** *Pragmatism* - NOT NEEDED FOR FINAL ARGUMENT

### Might Reconsider
None - cuts were appropriate

## Priority Actions

1. **URGENT:** Verify Mill "experiments of life" citation
2. **ADD:** Quine (1969) "Epistemology Naturalized" 
3. **CONFIRM:** All other citations match Reference List A exactly

## Notes on Citation Style

Section 5 now uses in-text citations properly:
- (Dewey, 1925, pp. 34-35) with direct quote
- (Floridi, 2025b) for conceptual framework
- (Wheeler, 2018) for extended mind argument
- (Floridi, 2025a) for "distant writing"

Classical sources cited by standard reference:
- Theaetetus 155d
- Metaphysics 982b12-13

This matches standard philosophy paper conventions.
