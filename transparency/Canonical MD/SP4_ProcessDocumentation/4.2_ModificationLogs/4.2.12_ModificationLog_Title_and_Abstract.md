## 4.2.12 ModificationLog_Title_and_Abstract

**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Participants:** Michele Loi (author), ChatGPT (GPT-4), Claude 2 (abstract interlude)  
**Purpose:** To finalize the title and abstract of a paper on AI-assisted scholarship, reputational risk, and methodological transparency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context**

This conversation was initiated by Michele Loi to refine and finalize the title and abstract of a philosophical paper that is both an argument for new scholarly infrastructure and an enacted example of AI-assisted writing under full disclosure.

The log documents a collaborative process between the author and large language models, where LLMs were used iteratively—not as content generators, but as **conversational partners** in structure, tone, and rhetorical framing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conversation Phases**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Initial Title Structure: Between X and Self-Tracking**

- Explored a range of titles in the form:

  - *Between Prediction and Self-Tracking*

  - *Between Data Science and Self-Tracking*

  - *Between AI Slop and Self-Tracking*

- These helped articulate the **core tension**—between machine-generated output and epistemically tracked process—but felt conceptually heavy and tonally flat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. Reframing via Dr. Strangelove**

- Author proposed a shift to the two-part title format of:

*Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*

- This led to a wave of subtitle prototypes using ironic contrast or epistemic transformation, often including references to:

  - AI assistance

  - Self-tracking

  - Slop as a reputational category

- Multiple versions were tested for tone, rhetorical balance, and rhythm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Tone Calibration**

- Author explicitly rejected framing that implied apology, worry, or defensiveness:

*"I’m an assertive, self-confident type. And this is the most personal essay I wrote, ironically."*

- This helped distinguish between:

  - Titles that *explained or defended* the work

  - Titles that *asserted it confidently* within a structurally flawed system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. Claude Interlude (Abstract Condensation)**

- The author brought in a compressed version of the abstract refined with Claude 2.

- Claude’s contribution was to:

  - Remove repetitive phrasing

  - Tone down defensive framing

  - Reorganize the abstract around the proposal

- ChatGPT then helped revise this version to:

  - Reinforce institutional critique

  - Clarify that the paper is a *performed method*, not just a proposal

**Key addition:**

*“As a demonstration of this approach, the paper itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under full disclosure…”*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**5. Final Title Decision**

After reviewing multiple subtitle candidates — including:

- *How to Use AI and Self-Tracking Without Getting Dismissed as Slop*

- *How to Track AI Assistance and Stop Worrying About Slop*

…the author proposed a **final revision** that most precisely echoed *Dr. Strangelove* in **form, rhythm, and tone**:

**How I Started to Track AI Assistance and Stopped Worrying About Slop**

This title was **authored by Michele Loi**, not generated by ChatGPT. It was selected because it:

- Matches the **rhetorical structure and syllabic rhythm** of the original film subtitle

- Emphasizes **authorial initiative** and a **deliberate shift in attitude**

- Retains **“AI assistance”** as a practice and **“slop”** as a satirical institutional keyword

- Balances ironic distance with philosophical seriousness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Deliverables from the Session**

- Final two-part title

- Final abstract (with process acknowledgment)

- Title page with full author info

- This conversation log

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Closing Note**

This document records a structured, traceable exchange between a human author and language models — consistent with the methodological stance of the paper itself. The conversation was not merely instrumental but epistemic: part of the thinking, not outside of it.

This is not a defense of AI-assisted writing. It is **a demonstration of how such writing can be done rigorously, accountably, and legibly** — with models, with records, and with full epistemic authorship.
