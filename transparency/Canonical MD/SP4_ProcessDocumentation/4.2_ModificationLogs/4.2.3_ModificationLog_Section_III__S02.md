**MOD-001: Section 3 Completion and Revision for Redundancy**

**Date:** October 12, 2025

**What Was Written**

Section 3 develops the structural dilemma facing any new venue for AI-assisted scholarship:

Venues maintaining continuity with prestige structures inherit the incentive problems from Section 2

Venues achieving complete separation risk marginalization and irrelevance

The dilemma appears intractable: each horn precludes what the other requires

But both horns rest on assumptions that merit examination (sets up solution sections)

**Critical Revisions for Redundancy**

**User feedback round 1:** "LLM, just like many philosophers, tend to be repetitive, though for different reasons."  
**User feedback round 2:** "Now the problem is redundancy relative to the previous sections... reference, instead of repeating."

**Two Types of Redundancy Addressed**

**Internal redundancy (within Section 3):**

Cut restatement paragraphs

Condensed multi-paragraph elaborations

Eliminated meta-commentary

**Result:** 1,500→1,100 words

**Cross-section redundancy (relative to Section 2):**

Section 2 already established: three asymmetries, "just in case" reasoning, incentive gradient

Section 3 was RE-EXPLAINING these mechanisms

**Solution:** Reference Section 2's analysis, then immediately show application to new venue

Don't re-walk through the asymmetries or elaborate on the psychology

Focus on NEW insight: contiguous venues inherit this structure

**Specific Cuts Made (Round 2)**

**Contiguous Approach subsection:**

**Original:** ~600 words elaborating how scholars evaluate submissions, re-explaining "just in case" reasoning, walking through "what if this becomes my most-cited work"

**Revised:** ~250 words that (1) describe generic contiguous venue, (2) reference Section 2's analysis, (3) show the structure applies here too

**Cut:** ~350 words of re-explanation

**Result:** Much tighter, assumes reader has internalized Section 2

**Key principle established:** Reference previous sections' conclusions rather than re-deriving them. Each section should add new insights, not rehearse old ones.

**Methodological Adherence**

Successfully implemented MOD-19-20 guidance PLUS new anti-redundancy discipline:

✓ Flowing prose: No bullet points or numbered lists in body text

✓ Balanced presentation: Both contiguity and separation problems given appropriate weight

✓ Generic examples: No specific journals or venues analyzed

✓ Epistemic humility: Conditional language for empirical claims

✓ Minimal Section 2 reference: Reference conclusion without rehearsing mechanisms

✓ Natural transitions: Each subsection advances argument

✓ LEAN: Cut ~550 words total (both internal and cross-section redundancy)

✓ REFERENCE not REPEAT: Trust reader has internalized previous sections

**Key Structural Moves**

**Opening transition:** Connects to Section 2's conclusion about structural incentives

**Contiguous approach:** References Section 2's asymmetries, shows they apply to new venue - NOW MUCH TIGHTER

**Separation approach:** Introduces "ghetto problem" and knowledge-production concerns

**Dilemma synthesis:** Frames as genuinely structural

**Forward-looking conclusion:** Leaner bridge to Section 4

**Connection to Overall Argument Arc**

**Completed sections:**

Preliminary Note: Methodological disclosure

Introduction: Current debates and policy landscape

Section 2: Incentive analysis (~1,400 words)

Section 3: Why obvious solutions fail (~950 words) ← REVISED TWICE

**Next sections:**

Section 4: Unfair reviews (target ~700-800 words - keep very lean, reference Sections 2-3)

Section 5: Positive motivations

Section 6-7: Two-component solution

Section 8: Review mechanism

Section 9: Conclusion

**Lessons for Future Sections**

**Anti-redundancy discipline**

**Internal (within section):**

Don't restate what's already been established in the same section

Avoid "This is not X but Y" formulations that just restate the argument

Cut meta-commentary ("The point here is...", "Simply put...")

Condense related points into single paragraphs

Trust the reader to follow without excessive hand-holding

**Cross-section (relative to previous sections):**

REFERENCE previous conclusions, don't RE-DERIVE them

Previous sections have done the work - assume reader has internalized it

Show how previous analysis applies to new case, don't re-explain the analysis

Each section should add NEW insights, not rehearse old ones

If you're tempted to write "As Section X established..." and then re-explain what Section X established, STOP - just reference and move on

**Quality \> length:**

No artificial length targets

Write what the argument needs

Cut ruthlessly in revision

Prefer tight argumentation to expansive elaboration

**Quality Check**

Section 3 successfully:

Advances argument beyond Section 2 without redundancy ← KEY IMPROVEMENT

Presents balanced analysis of both dilemma horns

Maintains philosophical tone and style

Sets up future sections without revealing solutions

Uses ~950 words efficiently (was ~1,500 before cuts)

**NEW:** Models lean philosophical prose without LLM-typical repetitiveness

**NEW:** References rather than repeats previous sections' work

**Critical Guidance for Section 4**

Section 4 must be VERY lean because:

Sections 2-3 have done heavy lifting on incentive/structural problems

Section 4 adds ONE more barrier (unfair reviews)

Should reference Sections 2-3's conclusions without re-explaining

Focus on NEW element: empirical test case using this paper itself

**Target:** ~700-800 words maximum

**Status:** Ready for Section 4 (with heightened awareness of both internal and cross-section redundancy)
