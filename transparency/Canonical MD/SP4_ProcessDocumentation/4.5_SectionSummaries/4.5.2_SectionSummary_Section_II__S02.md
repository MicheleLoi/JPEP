# **Section 2**

**Status:** Complete (~1,400 words)  
**Purpose:** For argument continuity in subsequent chats

## **Section 2 Main Argument**

Section 2 analyzes how current publishing policies create a perverse
incentive structure: scholars face the strongest temptation to
underreport AI involvement precisely in work they regard as most
significant.

## **2.1 The Incentive Gradient**

Establishes three asymmetric conditions affecting disclosure decisions:

1.  **Disclosure is permanent** - methodological characterizations
    become part of scholarly record

2.  **Significance is uncertain** - authors cannot predict at submission
    which papers will prove influential

3.  **Professional costs are front-loaded** - stigma associated with
    disclosed AI assistance operates immediately

These asymmetries create a gradient: as perceived work significance
increases, reported AI involvement decreases. Minor/routine work carries
low disclosure costs; potentially significant work creates dilemma
between honesty and perceived legitimacy; career-defining work creates
maximum incentive to underreport.

## **2.2 The Underreporting Mechanism**

Identifies four plausible mechanisms (framed as candidate explanations
requiring empirical validation) that could allow underreporting without
conscious dishonesty:

1.  **Definitional flexibility** - Terms like "substantial AI
    assistance" lack precise boundaries; uncertainty could resolve
    toward lower reported involvement when stakes are high

2.  **Temporal discounting** - Authors might privilege later revision
    stages (human-heavy) while backgrounding earlier exploration
    (AI-heavy)

3.  **Comparative framing** - Authors could compare their process to
    hypothetical greater AI dependence rather than traditional
    unassisted scholarship, genuinely believing they're reporting
    honestly while obscuring shift from traditional norms

4.  **Strategic vagueness** - Formal disclosure requirements rarely
    specify granularity, potentially creating space for minimally
    informative but formally adequate statements

Key insight: These mechanisms could operate through sincere belief in
accounts that happen to serve professional interests.

## **2.3 The Transparency Paradox**

The incentive structure creates three paradoxical outcomes:

1.  **Inverted relationship** - Where transparency matters most
    (influential work), we get least; where it matters least (minor
    work), disclosure costs are lower

2.  **Minimal disclosure** - Policies requiring disclosure create formal
    compliance without substantive transparency (resembles tax code
    compliance)

3.  **Selection effects** - Scholars most committed to transparency may
    self-select out of prestigious venues, leaving them populated by
    those willing to minimize reported AI involvement

Result: Incentive structure systematically undermines the transparency
disclosure policies aim to achieve.

## **2.4 Implications for Venue Design**

**Key conclusion for subsequent sections:** Any venue positioning itself
as contiguous with traditional prestige systems will inherit the same
incentive problems. If a venue is understood as potentially countable
for tenure, citable in prestigious journals, or subject to validation by
traditional metrics, authors face the same "just in case" reasoning:
"What if this becomes my most-cited work? I should minimize reported AI
involvement, just in case."

**Transition point:** Addressing the incentive problem requires more
than procedural changes—it requires structural discontinuity from the
prestige economy that generates these incentives.

## **Connection to Section 3**

Section 2 establishes that incentive problem is structural, not
individual. Section 3 should examine why approaches maintaining
continuity with traditional venues fail to solve the transparency
problem, and explore the fundamental tension between seeking validation
and maintaining distinct norms.
