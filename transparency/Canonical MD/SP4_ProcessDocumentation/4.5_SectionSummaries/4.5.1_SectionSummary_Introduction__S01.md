# **Introduction**

## **Section Overview**

**Word count**: ~1,400 words  
**Status**: Complete, author-approved  
**Modification tracker**: MOD-18 (3 iterations)

## **Key Moves**

### **Opening Frame**

- Introduces Floridi's "distant writing" concept as entry point

- Notes limitations for scholarly work (design/execution boundary
  unclear in philosophy)

- Establishes transformation in intellectual work production

### **Current Debates (Bracketed)**

**Pedagogical debate**: Teaching anxiety (Jollimore, Berg, Rini)
explicitly set aside as outside paper scope **Research potential
debate**: Ontiveros & Clay's optimism noted but concerns specialized
tools, not general LLMs; moderate voices note existing delegation
practices

### **Policy Landscape**

- Near-unanimous consensus: AI cannot be authors (COPE, Elsevier, ACM,
  Science)

- Mandatory disclosure required (Lund & Naheem: 50%+ of journals have
  policies)

- Boundaries established: AI as tool, not collaborator; disclosure
  required but minimized

### **The Paradox (Central Problem)**

- Policies demand transparency; culture penalizes it

- Professional costs create incentives to minimize reported AI
  involvement

- **Perverse gradient**: Most important work (career-defining) has
  strongest incentives for dishonesty

- Result: Where transparency matters most, we get least

### **Four Structural Gaps Identified**

1.  No venue for fully disclosed substantial AI assistance

2.  No positive case for AI-assisted scholarship (only defensive)

3.  Binary framework (author vs. tool) - no conceptual resources for
    distributed production

4.  No validation mechanism for disclosures (only self-reporting)

### **This Paper's Intervention**

Proposes **infrastructure** not position-taking:

- Alternative venue (journal or special track) for full disclosure
  without penalty

- Three functions: (1) transparency valued not penalized; (2) positive
  case articulation; (3) validation mechanism via review

### **Meta-Status Declaration**

Paper's submission trajectory provides empirical evidence:

- Rejection due to AI disclosure → validates barrier claim

- Acceptance despite disclosure → weakens (but doesn't eliminate) case

- Either way: valuable data about transparency and publishing norms

### **Roadmap (Sections 2-9)**

- Section 2: Incentive structure analysis

- Section 3: Why contiguous approaches fail

- Section 4: Unfair review problem (paper as test case)

- Section 5: Positive motivations for AI-assisted scholarship

- Section 6-7: Two-component solution

- Section 8: Split-review mechanism

- Section 9: Implications

## **Tone Established**

- Dry, philosophical prose (author-approved)

- No emotional appeals or excessive formatting

- Rigorous logical structure

- Direct acknowledgment of paper's meta-status without defensiveness

## **Citations Used**

ACM (2025), Berg & Robbins (2024), COPE Council (2024), Elsevier (2023),
Floridi (2025a), Jollimore (2025), Lund & Naheem (2023), Ontiveros &
Clay (2021), Rini (2025), Science (2023)

## **Foundation for Subsequent Sections**

- Problem clearly identified: incentive structure creates dishonesty
  gradient

- Gaps enumerated: provides structure for positive case (Section 5)

- Solution previewed: discontinuity + mandatory disclosure + validation
  mechanism

- Meta-commentary established: this paper tests its own hypothesis
