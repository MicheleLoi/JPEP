# **Section 4: The Problem of Unfair Reviews - Content Summary**

## **Status**

Complete (~750 words)

## **Main Argument**

Even scholars willing to disclose AI involvement fully may face
systematic resistance within traditional review processes. This adds a
practical barrier to the structural/incentive problems established in
Sections 2-3.

## **Key Content**

### **The Two Barriers**

1.  **Reviewer resistance**: Some reviewers may react negatively to
    reviewing what they regard as "AI slop" regardless of argument
    quality—disclosure itself triggers dismissal before substantive
    engagement

2.  **Editorial risk aversion**: Editors face professional costs of
    alienating reviewers by assigning AI-assisted work; incentive
    structure favors risk aversion even when editors might personally
    evaluate work fairly

### **How This Compounds Previous Problems**

- Section 2 established incentives to underreport

- Section 3 established structural dilemma for alternative venues

- Section 4 adds: Even scholars willing to accept disclosure costs may
  not receive fair evaluation

- Result: Transparency becomes professionally untenable even for those
  committed to it

### **This Paper as Empirical Test Case**

- Paper submitted to traditional philosophy journals with full
  disclosure (Preliminary Note + supplementary materials)

- Two possible outcomes, both instructive:

  - **If rejected for disclosure reasons**: Validates predicted
    barriers, demonstrates need for alternative venue

  - **If accepted despite disclosure**: Shows traditional venues CAN
    handle transparency, weakens (but doesn't eliminate) case for
    alternatives

- Either outcome advances understanding of publishing norms and
  methodological transparency

- Functions as straightforward empirical test

### **Epistemic Status**

Framed as **prediction/hypothesis**, not established fact:

- Uses conditional language throughout ("may encounter," "plausibly,"
  "if rejected," "if accepted")

- Acknowledges uncertainty about how traditional venues will respond

- Presents both possible outcomes as valuable data

- One empirical test, not conclusive proof

### **Connection to Overall Argument**

**Cumulative case building:**

- Section 2: Incentive problems (why scholars underreport)

- Section 3: Structural dilemma (why obvious fixes fail)

- Section 4: Practical barriers (why even willing scholars face
  obstacles)

- **Together**: Multiple barriers strengthen case for alternative
  infrastructure

### **Transition Function**

**Sets up Section 5**: "However, the proposal for such infrastructure
cannot rest solely on critique of existing systems. It must also address
why scholars should engage with AI-assisted methodology at all—what
positive motivations justify the professional costs and intellectual
risks."

## **What's NEW in Section 4**

- Does NOT re-explain Section 2's incentive mechanisms

- Does NOT re-derive Section 3's structural analysis

- ADDS: Review process barriers as distinct from incentive/structural
  problems

- ADDS: This paper as empirical test case (meta-level move)

- ADDS: Framework for interpreting submission outcomes

## **Methodological Notes**

Successfully avoided pitfalls from MOD guidance:

- Referenced previous sections without repeating their arguments

- Used epistemic humility consistently (predictions, not facts)

- Kept lean and focused (~750 words vs. 1,400 + 950 in Sections 2-3)

- No bullet points in body text

- Flowing philosophical prose

- Dry, non-defensive tone

## **Key Phrases/Concepts for Continuity**

- "systematic resistance within traditional review processes"

- "evaluative practices themselves" (not just incentive structures)

- "coordination problem" for editors

- "empirical assessment" through paper's submission trajectory

- "Both outcomes are instructive"

- Distinction between barriers (incentive vs. structural vs.
  practical/evaluative)

## **For Next Sections**

Section 5 must provide **positive motivations** for AI-assisted
scholarship (not just critique of barriers). The transition explicitly
frames this need.
