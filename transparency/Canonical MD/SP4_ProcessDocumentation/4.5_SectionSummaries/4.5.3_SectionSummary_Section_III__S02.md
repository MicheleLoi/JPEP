# **Section 3**

**Status:** Complete (~950 words after revision for redundancy)  
**Main argument:** Examines why maintaining continuity with traditional
venues fails to solve transparency problem, and why complete separation
risks irrelevance. Establishes structural dilemma.

**3.1 The Contiguous Approach and Its Failure**

- Describes venues designed to bridge between current practice and
  emerging methodologies

- **Core problem:** Given Section 2's analysis, if work could count for
  career advancement, scholars face the same incentive structure

- The asymmetries remain operative; "just in case" reasoning persists

- Procedural solutions ensure formal compliance while allowing latitude
  in characterization

**Important methodological note:** This subsection REFERENCES Section
2's analysis rather than re-deriving it—assumes reader has internalized
the three asymmetries and incentive dynamics.

**3.2 The Separation Alternative and Its Failure**

- Examines explicit discontinuity from traditional infrastructure

- **Why this addresses incentives:** If work won't contribute to
  traditional career advancement, "just in case" reasoning loses
  purchase

- **The ghetto problem:** Discontinuity creates prohibitive opportunity
  costs; venue risks becoming either space for established scholars'
  unconstrained projects OR refuge for work that couldn't meet
  traditional standards

- **Knowledge-production problem:** Marginalization undermines goal of
  understanding how AI-assisted scholarship works

**3.3 The Dilemma's Structure**

- **The structural tension:** Continuity → inherit incentive problems;
  Discontinuity → risk irrelevance

- Incentive problems arise from connection to prestige structures;
  solving them requires disconnection

- But disconnection risks marginalization; maintaining relevance
  requires connection

**3.4 Toward Resolution (Transition)**

- The dilemma may not be intractable

- Both horns depend on assumptions worth examining:

  - Does relevance depend entirely on traditional prestige markers?

  - Could it be grounded in other forms of value (methodological
    contribution, knowledge production)?

  - Must opportunity costs be framed as "time that doesn't count"?

- Sets up Section 4 as examining one additional barrier before
  presenting solution

## **Connection Between Completed Sections**

**Argument flow:**

1.  Introduction: Establishes the current policy landscape and missing
    infrastructure

2.  Section 2: Analyzes WHY current approaches fail (incentive
    structure)

3.  Section 3: Shows WHY obvious fixes fail (structural dilemma)

4.  Section 4: Will add ONE more barrier (unfair reviews)

5.  Sections 5-9: Will present positive motivations and the solution

## **Key Methodological Notes for Future Sections**

**From Section 3 revision:**

- REFERENCE previous conclusions, don't RE-DERIVE them

- Each section should add NEW insights, not rehearse old ones

- Trust reader has internalized previous sections

- Cut redundancy ruthlessly (both internal and cross-section)

**For Section 4 specifically:**

- Must be VERY lean (~700-800 words)

- Sections 2-3 have done heavy lifting; Section 4 adds one barrier

- Reference Sections 2-3 without re-explaining

- Focus on NEW element: this paper as empirical test case

- Don't overstate—one data point, not conclusive proof
