### 4.4.12 From Draft 1 (-Appendix) to Appendix A

**Updated Section Guidance: Appendix A - Documentation Structure and Reproduction Procedure**

**Source:** Complete Paper + Preliminary Chats + All Modification Logs  
**Target Length:** ~3,500-4,500 words  
**Tone:** Detailed, honest about messiness, explicitly relates to ecological validity principle  
**Date:** October 19, 2025

**CRITICAL CONTEXT: The Radical Renumbering**

All process artifacts (ModificationLogs, PatternSummaries, SectionGuidance, etc.) use original section numbers from the writing process. The final paper underwent radical renumbering after consolidation:

**WRITING PROCESS (artifact numbering):**

Introduction (1) → remains Section 1

Incentives (2) + Contiguous (3) + Reviews (4) → consolidated into Section 2

Why Engage (5) → renumbered to Section 3

Dilemma Reconsidered (6) → renumbered to Section 4

Discontinuity (7) → renumbered to Section 5

Mandatory Transparency (8) → renumbered to Section 6

Review Mechanism (9) → renumbered to Section 7

**Throughout the Appendix:** Use BOTH numbers consistently: "Section 5 (final Section 3)" to help readers navigate between artifacts (old numbers) and final paper (new numbers).

**Ecological Validity Note:** The preservation of original numbering in artifacts demonstrates the paper's own principle - documentation reflects actual process, not cleaned-up retrospective version.

**STRUCTURE**

**A.1: Overview of Reproduction Procedure (~400 words)**

**What Reviewer B receives:**

SP-1: Complete Prompt (~20 pages)

SP-2: Reproduction Package (~15-20 pages)

SP-3: Reproduction Guide (~5 pages)

**Basic workflow:**

Start with SP-3 (instructions)

Load SP-1 as primary input to LLM

Use SP-2 for section-by-section guidance, key insights, refinement patterns

Generate comparable work

Compare reproduction to submitted paper

**Time estimates:**

Reviewing materials: 2-3 hours

Conducting reproduction: 2-4 hours

Comparison and assessment: 1-2 hours

Total: ~5-9 hours for basic reproduction

Additional time if deeper investigation warranted

**Role of SP-3:** Provides instructions for combining SP-1 + SP-2, explains comparison criteria, specifies pass threshold

**A.2: Document Creation Flow and Relationships (~1,200-1,500 words)**

**THIS IS THE CORE SECTION**

Before describing the flow, present a conceptual graph/diagram description. The graph should show:

**Phase 1: Pre-Writing**

**Epistemic Traces (Type 2)** - exploratory conversations outside writing process

Arrow → **Prompt Development Log (Type 8)** - iterative refinement

Arrow → **Complete Prompt (Type 1)** - final synthesized instructions

**Key insight:** Epistemic Traces serve DUAL purpose:

**SOURCE MATERIAL** for developing Complete Prompt (converted into instructions)

**VOICE CALIBRATION** during writing (constant input like Complete Prompt)

**Phase 2: Main Writing (Sections 1-6, old numbering)**

For EACH section (1 through 6), show:

**Inputs:**

Complete Prompt (Type 1) - constant across all sections

Epistemic Traces (Type 2) - constant for voice calibration

Accumulated PatternSummaries from previous sections (Type 4) - growing collection

Accumulated SectionSummaries from previous sections (Type 5)

Accumulated ReferenceLogs from previous sections (Type 6, if applicable)

Section Guidance for THIS section (Type 3) - created either:

In preliminary chat BEFORE writing this section, OR

At end of PREVIOUS section as request before moving to new chat

**Process:**

Section drafted with LLM assistance

Iterative refinement through user feedback

Multiple rounds possible (Section 5: 13 modifications)

**Outputs:**

Section text (the actual paper content)

**ModificationLog_SectionX.md (Type 7)** - numbering restarts at MOD-001 for each section

Not verbatim conversation logs

Rewritten (with some condensing) documentation of changes

Captures everything: simple citation format → major conceptual restructuring → user corrections

**PatternSummary_SectionX.md (Type 4)** - extracted FROM ModificationLog after section complete

Specific intention: generalizable lessons useful for forward tasks

Not all modifications become patterns, only those with broader applicability

**SectionSummary_SectionX.md (Type 5)** - what this section says (argument, structure)

**ReferenceLog_SectionX.md (Type 6, if citations added)** - tracks sources

**SectionGuidance_SectionX+1.md (Type 3)** - created for NEXT section

**Visual representation:** Show accumulation clearly

Section 1 creates materials → Section 2 uses them + creates new materials → Section 3 uses accumulated + creates new → etc.

Growing arrow or stacked effect showing PatternSummary collection building

NOT a loop (same process, different content each time)

Forward-moving accumulation

**Phase 3: METHODOLOGY DESIGN BRANCH (Between old Section 6 and old Section 7)**

Show as branching path - qualitatively different from section-writing:

Preliminary chats about artifact ontology (MOD-M01 through MOD-M37)

Renaming/relabeling work

Creation of procedural guidance for Sections 8 & 9 (old numbers)

**Outputs:**

Methodology design materials (become part of SP-5: Development Records)

Section 8 & 9 guidance documents created ahead

New artifact naming conventions established

**Visual:** Branch off from main timeline, parallel track that feeds back in

**Phase 4: Later Writing (Sections 7-9, old numbering)**

**Section 7 (final Section 5) - Simpler Inputs:**

NO Complete Prompt (first time it's not used)

Section Guidance + overall paper structure (from Section 5 summaries)

Accumulated patterns and summaries

**CRITICAL: Section 7→8 Preliminary Chat with Complex Feedback Loop**

This is special - show detailed iteration:

Preliminary chat started to create ENDING for Section 7

Content generated → deemed poor quality

Feedback to chat → improved version generated

Decision made: this content belongs at BEGINNING of Section 8, not end of Section 7

Content repositioned (hence some renaming in logs)

New prompt created for Section 8 opening

Opening generated → still unsatisfactory

More feedback within Section 8 writing process

Final satisfactory version achieved

**Result:** This preliminary chat is logged in ModificationLog_Section8.md (old numbering) as preliminary chat material

**Visual:** Show curved feedback arrows, repositioning movement between sections

**Section 8 (final Section 6) - Complex Inputs (Complete Prompt Returns):**

Complete Prompt (Type 1) - returns after absence in Section 7

Section 8 Guidance (Type 3)

Preliminary Chat from Section 7 transition

Epistemic Traces (Type 2)

Full PatternSummary collection (all previous sections)

Guidance from Section 5→8 (created ahead of writing Section 7)

Guidance from Section 7→8

All accumulated section summaries

**Section 9 (final Section 7):**

Section 9 Guidance (from Section 8)

All section summaries (complete collection)

All pattern summaries (complete collection)

**Phase 5: Post-Draft Editorial Revision**

Show two parallel tracks:

**Track 1: Language/Tone Revision**

Sections 1 and 6 (old numbering) revised for experimental/exploratory tone

ModificationLogs document these changes

**Track 2: CONSOLIDATION EVENT**

Sections 2, 3, 4 (old numbering) merge into single Section 2 (new numbering)

Three separate ModificationLogs remain:

ModificationLog_Section2.md (original Incentives)

ModificationLog_Section3.md (original Contiguous Approaches)

ModificationLog_Section4.md (original Unfair Reviews)

Plus: ModificationLog_Section2_Consolidation.md (documents the merger)

**RADICAL RENUMBERING CONSEQUENCE:**

Everything from old Section 5 onward shifts down by 2 numbers

All artifacts keep original numbering (ecological validity)

**Visual:** Show convergence of three boxes into one, with cascading renumbering effect on all subsequent sections

**Phase 6: Appendix (Special Status)**

Different representation: Different shape/color to indicate special status

The "nexus of the self-reflective experiment"

**Multiple input streams:**

All ModificationLogs from all sections

All PatternSummaries

All SectionGuidances

All Development Records (methodology design)

Preliminary Chat with multiple iterations

Complete Prompt

Epistemic Traces

**Visual:** Many arrows converging from all previous phases

**Ecological Validity Connection (Critical Paragraph)**

After describing the graph, explicitly state:

"This complex, iterative, sometimes messy process demonstrates the ecological validity principle this paper advocates. Real creative scholarly work involves false starts, repositioned content, multiple rounds of feedback, and decisions that create documentation challenges (like the renumbering). The preliminary chat for the Section 7→8 transition generated poor output initially - this is normal and valuable to document rather than hide. The mismatch between artifact numbering (original sections) and final paper numbering (after consolidation) is a feature, not a bug. It shows the actual development process rather than a cleaned-up retrospective version. Transparent documentation means preserving what really happened, including the parts that don't fit neatly into predetermined categories."

**A.3: The 11 Document Types (~800-1,000 words)**

Organize by phase of creation (Pre-Writing, Writing, Post-Writing).

**WRITING PHASE TYPES (Foundation & Execution)**

**Type 1: Complete Prompt**

**Created:** Before writing begins (result of prompt development process)

**Purpose:** Foundational instruction document for generating paper

**Content:** ~20 pages of synthesized specifications - full argument structure, section requirements, tone guidelines

**Role in forward writing:** Yes - constant primary input throughout sections 1-6 and 8 (old numbering). Temporarily absent for Section 7.

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows what instructions guided the work

**File:** CompletePrompt.md

**Type 2: Epistemic Trace**

**Created:** Asynchronously to linear section-writing process

**Defining Characteristic:** ONE-TO-MANY INFLUENCE

Foundational documents that influence multiple downstream outputs

Not tied to single section execution

Exploratory/preparatory work happening outside main sequence

**Purpose:** Foundational with broad influence

Source material for frameworks, concepts, structures used across multiple sections

Voice/style preservation used throughout writing

Strategic/conceptual work informing multiple later decisions

**Content:**

Verbatim or near-verbatim excerpts (with redactions) from exploratory conversations

Phase-based narrative format showing back-and-forth dialogue

Can include: methodology design dialogues, editorial consultations, architectural planning

Characterized by asynchrony: working ahead or stepping outside linear flow

**Examples in this paper:**

Primary Epistemic Trace: Early conceptual explorations → informed Complete Prompt + voice throughout

Methodology Design preliminary chats: Sections 8/9/Appendix infrastructure explored while writing earlier sections

Values framework dialogue: Level 1 vs Level 2 distinction applied across documentation

Editorial Audit: One consultation → multiple section revisions

**Role in forward writing:** Variable - some constant (voice), some influence specific later sections

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows foundational thinking that shaped multiple outputs

**Key distinction from other types:**

Section Guidance (Type 3) = one-to-ONE (specific section)

Pattern Summary (Type 4) = accumulative/sequential (builds forward)

Epistemic Trace (Type 2) = one-to-MANY (foundational influence)

**File pattern:** EpistemicTrace_TopicDescriptor.md or PreliminaryChat_SectionX_ChatY.md

**Type 3: Section Guidance**

**Created:** BEFORE writing each section, through two possible mechanisms:

Preliminary chat/dialogue session before writing begins, OR

Request created at END of previous section completion, before moving to new chat

**Purpose:** Section-specific instructions for writing

**Content:**

Structural deviations from Complete Prompt

Continuity requirements (what to reference vs. repeat)

Planned connections to previous sections

Methodological guidance

**Role in forward writing:** Yes - direct input to that section's writing

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows how sections connected

**File pattern:** SectionGuidance_SectionX.md

**Type 4: Pattern Summary**

**Created:** AFTER section complete, extracted FROM Modification Log

**Purpose:** Generalizable lessons useful for forward tasks

**Content:**

NOT all modifications become patterns

Only those with broader applicability

Reusable guidance for similar work

Examples: "Attribution precision patterns," "Redundancy elimination approaches"

**Role in forward writing:** Yes - input to NEXT sections (accumulating resource)

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows methodological learning

**File pattern:** PatternSummary_SectionX.md

**Type 5: Section Summary**

**Created:** AFTER section complete

**Purpose:** What this section says (argument, key moves, structure)

**Content:** Used to maintain coherence across sections

**Role in forward writing:** Yes - input to NEXT sections for continuity

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows argument flow

**File pattern:** SectionSummary_SectionX.md

**Type 6: Reference Log**

**Created:** AFTER section complete (only if section adds citations)

**Purpose:** Track citations added in this section

**Content:** How each source used, relation to previous sources

**Note:** Only created for sections that add literature

**Role in forward writing:** Yes - input to NEXT sections (avoid redundancy, build on previous sources)

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows source engagement depth

**File pattern:** ReferenceLog_SectionX.md

**Type 7: Modification Log**

**Created:** DURING section writing, documenting iterative refinement

**Purpose:** Track what changed and why

**Content:**

NOT verbatim conversation logs

Rewritten (with some condensing) documentation of changes

Captures spectrum: simple citation format → major conceptual restructuring → user corrections ("cut this, I hate it")

Shows reasoning behind changes

**Numbering:** Restarts at MOD-001 for each section (self-contained)

**Role in forward writing:** No (retrospective record only)

**Role in documentation:** Yes - shows author's reasoning about changes

**File pattern:** ModificationLog_SectionX.md

**PRE-WRITING PHASE TYPE**

**Type 8: Prompt Development Log**

**Created:** Before or between sections when guidance is being developed

**Purpose:** Document evolution of instructions (not ideas themselves)

**Content:** Structured documentation showing how exploration became actionable instructions

Uses PDL-XXX numbering format (PDL-001, PDL-002, etc.)

Each entry shows: Issue identified → Changes made → Rationale → Impact

**Critical distinction:**

Preliminary chats where exploration occurs = **Type 2** (Epistemic Traces) - verbatim/near-verbatim dialogue

Structured logs documenting how that exploration became guidance = **Type 8** (Prompt Development Logs) - decision tracking

**Key rule:** If the document is structured as 'PDL-XXX' or similar, tracking decisions that culminate in creating a prompt or guidance document, it's Type 8. If it's exploratory dialogue, it's Type 2.

**Two contexts:**

**Complete Prompt development (Type 8a):** Shows how Epistemic Traces (Type 2) converted into Complete Prompt (Type 1) through iterative refinement

**Section Guidance development (Type 8b):** Structured documentation showing how Epistemic Traces (Type 2 preliminary chats in SP-4 Part 7) + feedback loops became section-specific instructions. Each PDL entry shows: Issue identified → Changes made → Rationale → Impact. Example: PromptDevelopmentLog_Section7.md shows PDL-001 through PDL-007 tracking defensive→constructive reframing.

**Role in forward writing:** No (the Complete Prompt or Section Guidance itself is what's used)

**Role in documentation:** Yes - transparency about instruction development

**Relationship:** Type 2 (Epistemic Traces) → feeds → Type 8 (Prompt Development Logs) → produces → Type 1 (Complete Prompt) or Type 3 (Section Guidance)

**File pattern:** PromptDevelopmentLog.md or PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md

**POST-WRITING PHASE TYPES**

**Type 9: Reproduction Package**

**Created:** AFTER all sections complete

**Purpose:** Processed compilation enabling reproduction

**Content:** Generated via preprocessing prompt from SP-4 (all Type 1-8 materials)

**Structure:** Six sections:

Architectural Overview

Guidance Patterns Across Sections

Refinement Patterns

**Part 6: Reference Logs (Type 6)**

Only sections with citations (not all sections have these)

Used in forward writing + documentation

**Part 7: ALL Epistemic Traces (Type 2)**

**Definition note:** Epistemic Traces are foundational documents characterized by one-to-many influence - they're created asynchronously to linear section writing and shape multiple downstream outputs. Format: verbatim or near-verbatim exploratory dialogue, often in Phase-based narrative structure.

**Primary:** EpistemicTrace_OriginalTextExtractforFinalSynthesis.md

Early conceptual explorations about the journal idea

Influenced both Complete Prompt development and voice calibration across all sections

**Methodology Design:** PreliminaryChat sessions documenting artifact ontology development (MOD-M01 through MOD-M37)

How review mechanism and documentation structure developed

Became basis for Sections 8, 9, Appendix infrastructure

**Section 7-8 Development:** PreliminaryChat_Section7_Chat2.md and PreliminaryChat_Section8_Chat2.md

Values analysis (epistemic, pedagogical, traditional values)

Level 1 vs Level 2 distinction

Repositioning decisions and philosophical grounding

**Any other epistemic traces** created asynchronously to linear writing

**SP-5: Development Records (~10-15 pages)**

Contains ONLY Type 8 (Prompt Development Logs) + Type 11 (Notes) - the meta-level documentation of how instructions evolved:

**Part 1: Prompt Development Log - Complete Prompt (Type 8a)**

PromptDevelopmentLog.md

PDL-001 through final version

Shows how Epistemic Traces (now in SP-4 Part 7) → Complete Prompt (Type 1)

Structured decision tracking with PDL-XXX format

**Part 2: Prompt Development Logs - Section Guidance (Type 8b)**

PromptDevelopmentLog_Section7.md (PDL-001 through PDL-007: defensive → constructive reframing)

PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md (if applicable for other sections)

Shows how Epistemic Traces (Type 2 preliminary chats in SP-4 Part 7) became Section Guidance (Type 3)

Structured logs documenting refinement process, NOT the exploratory dialogue itself

**Part 3: Reference Verification Notes (Type 11)**

Citations checked for accuracy

Not methodologically central but supports integrity

**Part 4: Organizational Documentation (Type 11)**

Renaming/relabeling documentation

File structure decisions

Other working notes

**Total Volume:** ~80-110 pages

Reviewer B needs ~25-45 pages for basic reproduction (SP-1, SP-2, SP-3)

Full transparency materials available in SP-4 and SP-5 for deeper investigation

**Organizational Logic:**

**SP-4** = Everything FROM the writing process (what guided it, what changed, what was learned, what sourced it)

**SP-5** = Documentation OF how guidance evolved (meta-level: how source material became actionable instructions) + technical notes

**A.5: Guide to Using Supplementary Materials (~400 words)**

**For Reviewer B (Reproduction Task):**

**Start with SP-3 (Reproduction Guide)**

Read procedure instructions first

Understand pass criteria

Note the numbering mismatch (see mapping table in A.4)

**Load SP-1 (Complete Prompt) as primary input**

This is the main instruction set

~20 pages of synthesized guidance

**Use SP-2 (Reproduction Package) for:**

Section-by-section guidance on how arguments developed

Key insights checklist (what should appear in reproduction)

Refinement patterns (what editorial improvements to expect)

Development flow (how ideas emerged and evolved)

**Generate comparable work:**

Follow procedure in SP-3

Use SP-1 as base instructions

Reference SP-2 for each section's specifics

Expected time: 2-4 hours for generation

**Compare and assess:**

Intellectual architecture match? (trajectory, not output)

Key insights present?

Argument structure reproducible?

Gap attributable to expected refinement?

**If needed, consult SP-4 (Process Documentation):**

Available for deeper investigation

Particularly useful if reproduction unclear

ModificationLogs show detailed development

PatternSummaries show what was learned

Epistemic Traces show foundational thinking

Remember artifact numbering (old sections) vs. final paper numbering

**For Editorial Assessment:**

SP-1: Shows documented inputs (what author claimed to use)

SP-2: Provides processed overview (synthesized patterns)

SP-3: Explains procedure (how to verify)

SP-4: Demonstrates transparency depth (full process visible)

SP-5: Shows instruction development (how guidance evolved)

**For Methodological Researchers:**

SP-4 Part 7: Epistemic Traces show intellectual origins and foundational conversations

SP-4 Part 2: Modification Logs document iterative refinement

SP-4 Part 3: Pattern Summaries show methodological learning

SP-5 Part 1: Prompt Development Log shows Complete Prompt evolution

SP-5 Part 2: Section-level Prompt Development Logs show guidance refinement

**Note on Numbering:** All documentation uses original section numbers from writing process. Refer to mapping table in A.4 when connecting to final paper sections. This preservation of original numbering demonstrates ecological validity - showing actual process rather than cleaned-up version.

**CRITICAL WRITING PRINCIPLES**

**Ecological Validity Framing Throughout**

Don't apologize for messiness - celebrate it as demonstration of principle

Key phrases to use:

"This preservation of original numbering exemplifies ecological validity"

"The iterative refinement visible in modification logs shows real creative process"

"Preliminary chats sometimes generated poor output requiring feedback - this is normal and valuable to document"

"Real scholarly work involves false starts and repositioned content"

Show, don't tell: The appendix itself demonstrates what it describes

**Both Numbers Always (Especially in A.4)**

First reference: "Section 5 (final Section 3)"

Subsequent in same paragraph: can use just one if clear from context

When in doubt, use both

In A.4 particularly: be explicit and consistent

**Mapping Table Early and Often**

Full table at beginning of A.4

Reference it when needed: "See mapping table in A.4"

Don't assume reader memorizes the mapping

Make it easy to cross-reference

**Visual/Spatial Language for Graph (A.2)**

Write as if describing a diagram someone could draw

Use directional language: "flows into," "branches from," "accumulates through," "converges into"

Use spatial language: "left to right," "parallel tracks," "feedback loop curves back"

Use visual markers: "different shape/color," "growing arrow," "stacked effect"

Clear enough that someone could sketch it from description

**Acknowledge Collaborative Nature**

Modification logs show "user feedback identified..." "recognition that..." "correction applied..."

This is AI-assisted work - show the assistance and the iteration

Don't hide the back-and-forth

Examples: "User correction: 'cut this, I hate it'" → documented honestly

**Honest About Iteration**

Section 5 (final Section 3): "underwent 13 modifications through dialogue"

Section 7→8 preliminary chat: "multiple rounds of feedback"

"Content initially deemed poor → feedback → improved version"

Real creative work is iterative - show it

**Forward References to Demonstration**

"This paper's supplementary materials demonstrate this approach"

"The materials submitted with this paper follow this structure"

Connect description to actual implementation throughout

**Maintain Appropriate Abstraction Level**

Conceptual explanation, not technical specification

Philosophy paper, not software documentation

Detailed enough to assess plausibility

General enough to allow community evolution

"Proof-of-concept" stance maintained

**Type 2 vs Type 8 Distinction Always Clear**

Emphasize format differences (Phase-based narrative vs PDL-XXX numbering)

Emphasize functional differences (exploration vs documentation of refinement)

Use concrete examples showing the difference

Make the relationship explicit: Type 2 feeds Type 8

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**

✅ Clarity: Reader can understand document flow from graph description  
✅ Completeness: All 11 types clearly defined with purposes and relationships  
✅ Navigation: Numbering mismatch explained clearly with mapping table used consistently  
✅ Principles: Ecological validity principle explicitly connected to documentation messiness  
✅ Honesty: Iterative/organic nature captured, not idealized or cleaned up  
✅ Distinction: Special phases (methodology design, consolidation, Section 7→8 transition) clearly marked  
✅ Usability: Reviewer B could use A.5 to understand and navigate supplementary materials  
✅ Consistency: Both numbers (old/new) used throughout A.4 especially  
✅ Visualization: Graph description detailed enough someone could sketch it  
✅ Demonstration: Connects description to this paper's actual implementation  
✅ Tone: Maintains philosophical approach, not technical specification  
✅ Type Clarity: Type 2 vs Type 8 distinction unmistakable with clear examples

**AVOID**

❌ Apologizing for complexity (frame as valuable transparency)  
❌ Idealizing the process (show real iteration, false starts)  
❌ Using only new numbers in A.4 (reader has artifacts with old numbers)  
❌ Technical jargon without explanation  
❌ Prescriptive language (this is proof-of-concept)  
❌ Abstract description without concrete reference to this paper's materials  
❌ Hiding user corrections or feedback loops  
❌ Clean linear narrative that erases actual development  
❌ Conflating Type 2 and Type 8 (exploration vs documentation)

**READY TO WRITE**

This guidance provides:

Complete structure (A.1 through A.5)

Critical context (radical renumbering)

Detailed specifications (11 document types, 6 phases)

Writing principles (ecological validity framing, both numbers, Type 2/8 distinction, etc.)

Success criteria (what makes appendix work)

The appendix should feel like: "Here's what we actually did, documented honestly, demonstrating the transparency we advocate."
