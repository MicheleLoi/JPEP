### 4.4.10 Section Guidance: Introduction (tone changes) and Section IV

Introduction (Section 1) Revision

**Objective**

Moderate framing from prescriptive to experimental while preserving argumentative force. Acknowledge methodological reflexivity without undermining the approach.

**Specific Changes Needed**

**Framing Shift**: Change from "this paper proposes" to "this paper explores" or "this paper tests"

**Methodological Acknowledgment**: Add 2-3 sentences acknowledging the bootstrapping paradox: "This paper faces a methodological paradox - it asks readers to evaluate a transparency framework through an example that presupposes the framework's value. However, this circularity serves an epistemic function..."

**Conditional Language**: When referencing policy implications, use "if such approaches prove viable..." rather than definitive statements

**Cost Signaling Emphasis**: Strengthen the argument that philosophy needs meaningful barriers between genuine intellectual work and sophisticated-sounding AI text generation

**Preserve**

Floridi engagement

Gap identification in current debates

Overall argumentative trajectory

Intellectual ambition
