# SESSION PROMPT: Write Section 4 of AI-Assisted Scholarship Paper

  

## Your Task

  

Write **Section 4: The Problem of Unfair Reviews** for an academic philosophy paper arguing for a new venue for AI-assisted scholarship.

  

**Target length:** ~700-800 words (VERY lean - this is critical)

  

## Context: What You're Working With

  

You have access to five essential documents that contain everything you need:

  

1. **[paper-prompt-complete]** - Full paper specifications including overall argument, proposed solution, review mechanism, tone requirements

2. **[epistemic-trace-doc]** - Original dialogue excerpts showing how the argument was developed, voice/tone calibration

3. **[methodological-guidance]** - Critical lessons from previous sections (MOD-19-20-21) on style, epistemic humility, and anti-redundancy discipline

4. **[sections-completed-summary]** - What Sections 1-3 have already established (READ THIS CAREFULLY to avoid redundancy)

5. **[references-master-list]** - Available citations organized by section

  

**Read these documents carefully before writing.** Especially [methodological-guidance] and [sections-completed-summary].

  

## What's Been Completed So Far

  

**Preliminary Note:** Full methodological disclosure that this paper was written through AI-assisted dialogue

  

**Introduction:** Current debates, journal policies, the paradox (policies demand transparency but transparency carries cost), missing infrastructure

  

**Section 2: Incentives Analysis (~1,400 words):**

- Established three asymmetries: permanent disclosure, uncertain significance, front-loaded costs

- Showed how this creates incentive gradient (most important work → most underreporting)

- Identified four plausible underreporting mechanisms

- Concluded: any contiguous venue will inherit these problems

  

**Section 3: Why Contiguous Approaches Fail (~950 words):**

- Contiguous venues (seeking eventual validation) inherit Section 2's incentive problems

- Separated venues (explicit discontinuity) risk marginalization and irrelevance ("ghetto problem")

- Established structural dilemma: continuity → incentive problems; discontinuity → irrelevance

- Noted dilemma may not be intractable (sets up solution sections)

  

## What Section 4 Must Do

  

**Purpose:** Add ONE additional barrier showing that even scholars willing to disclose face systematic obstacles in traditional venues.

  

**Content (from [paper-prompt-complete]):**

1. **Two predicted problems:**

   - Reviewer resistance: Some reviewers will react negatively to reviewing "AI slop" regardless of quality

   - Editorial risk aversion: Editors may be wary of alienating reviewers by sending AI-assisted submissions

  

2. **This paper as empirical test case:**

   - When submitted with full disclosure to traditional philosophy journals, what happens?

   - Either outcome provides valuable data:

     - If rejected for disclosure reasons → validates need for alternative venue

     - If accepted → demonstrates traditional venues CAN handle disclosed work (weakens but doesn't eliminate the case)

  

3. **Brief transition to Section 5:** This additional barrier strengthens the case for alternative infrastructure, but the proposal must also address why scholars should participate

  

## Critical Methodological Requirements

  

### 1. REFERENCE, DON'T REPEAT (Most Important)

  

**The problem:** Section 4 could easily re-explain what Sections 2-3 already established.

  

**The solution:**

- Sections 2-3 have done the conceptual work - assume reader has internalized them

- Use brief references: "Section 2 established that..." or "Given Section 3's analysis..."

- Focus on what's NEW: the review process barrier as distinct from incentive structure

  

**Test question:** "Is this sentence re-explaining something from Sections 2-3, or adding something genuinely new?"

- If re-explaining → cut or condense to a reference

- If new → keep and develop

  

### 2. Epistemic Humility

  

This is a **prediction/hypothesis**, not established fact:

- Use conditional language: "may face," "plausibly," "could"

- This paper is ONE data point, not conclusive evidence

- Acknowledge uncertainty - traditional venues might handle this well

- Frame as empirical prediction that will be tested, not certain outcome

  

**Avoid:**

- "Demonstrates," "proves," "shows definitively"

- Overstating the empirical claim

- Suggesting this is already proven

  

**Use instead:**

- "This paper predicts," "plausibly," "may encounter"

- "Either outcome would provide valuable data"

  

### 3. Keep It VERY Lean

  

**Why 700-800 words:**

- Sections 2-3 did the heavy conceptual lifting (~2,350 words combined)

- Section 4 adds a practical/empirical consideration (supporting, not primary argument)

- Next sections (5-9) need space for positive case and solution

- Brevity signals appropriate weight in overall argument

  

**How to stay lean:**

- Make your points clearly and concisely

- No unnecessary elaboration

- Trust reader to understand implications

- If a sentence doesn't add new information, cut it

- This should feel like a brief but important addition, not a major pivot

  

### 4. Flowing Philosophical Prose

  

**From [methodological-guidance]:**

- NO bullet points or numbered lists in the body text

- NO bold headers for subsections

- Write as continuous argument with connecting phrases

- Use *italics* for key terms only

  

### 5. Tone Requirements

  

**From [paper-prompt-complete]:**

- Dry, philosophical prose

- NOT defensive or emotional

- NOT asking for sympathy

- Present as straightforward empirical prediction

- Acknowledge when conclusions are uncertain

  

## Suggested Structure (Not Prescriptive)

  

**Opening (~100 words):**

- Transition from Section 3

- Even if structural problems could be addressed, there's a practical barrier

  

**The Barrier (~300 words):**

- Describe the two predicted problems concisely

- Reviewer resistance + editorial risk aversion

  

**This Paper as Test Case (~200 words):**

- Note this paper's submission trajectory will provide empirical evidence

- Frame as straightforward experiment

  

**Epistemic Consequence (~150 words):**

- Explain what either outcome would show

- Both rejection and acceptance are informative

  

**Transition (~50 words):**

- This additional barrier strengthens case for alternative infrastructure

- But proposal must also address why scholars should participate (sets up Section 5)

  

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

  

Based on [methodological-guidance], watch out for:

  

1. **Re-deriving previous sections' conclusions** - biggest risk for Section 4

2. **"This is not X but Y" restatements** - just make your point directly

3. **Meta-commentary** - "The point here is..." (just make the point)

4. **Excessive elaboration** - resist the urge to over-explain

5. **Overstating epistemic status** - this is hypothesis, not proof

  

## Quality Check Before Submitting

  

Ask yourself:

1. Is this ~700-800 words? (If significantly longer, cut)

2. Did I reference Sections 2-3 without re-explaining them?

3. Did I use epistemic humility (conditional language, acknowledge uncertainty)?

4. Does every paragraph add something NEW, or am I repeating previous sections?

5. Is this flowing prose without bullet points/lists?

6. Is the tone dry and philosophical, not emotional or defensive?

  

## After Writing Section 4

  

Create two artifacts:

1. **[section-4-draft]** - The actual section text

2. **[section-4-summary]** - Brief content summary (~300-400 words) for use in subsequent chats, noting what's new and how it connects to other sections

  

## Key Principle

  

**This paper is arguing for transparency and rigor in AI-assisted scholarship. The writing itself must model that transparency and rigor by:**

- Avoiding LLM-typical redundancy patterns

- Using precise, conditional language for empirical claims

- Building arguments cumulatively (reference, don't repeat)

- Maintaining philosophical quality throughout

  

The revision process has been transparent (MOD-19, MOD-20, MOD-21 document all corrections). Continue that transparency by writing carefully and revising thoughtfully.

**Now write Section 4: The Problem of Unfair Reviews**

  

Remember: ~700-800 words, reference don't repeat, epistemic humility, lean and focused.
