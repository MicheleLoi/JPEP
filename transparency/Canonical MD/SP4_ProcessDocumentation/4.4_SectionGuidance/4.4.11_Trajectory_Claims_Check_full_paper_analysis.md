# 4.4.11 Trajectory Claims Check (Full Paper Analysis)

**Document Type:** Type 4 - Section Guidance (Coordination Development)

**Date:** 18 October 2025 (original conversation), Reconstruction on 02/01/2026

## Revision Requirements by Section

### Introduction Meta-Status Declaration

**Current problematic language:** "Rejection due to AI disclosure → validates barrier claim"

**Required changes:**
- Remove claim that rejection validates barriers
- Add acknowledgment that rejection cannot be interpreted as transparency evidence
- Maintain that acceptance would demonstrate institutional capacity
- Frame as modest case study contributing to understanding rather than testing hypothesis

**Tone target:** Match conclusion's intellectual honesty and appropriate modesty

### Section IV: "This Paper as Empirical Test Case"

**Current problematic language:** "If rejected for disclosure reasons: Validates predicted barriers"

**Required changes:**
- Same logical corrections as Introduction
- Keep conditional framing ("if rejected," "if accepted") but correct the logic
- Remove validation language for rejection outcome
- Maintain that both outcomes contribute data while acknowledging rejection's limitations
- Emphasize single case study status

**Preserve:** The section's function of adding practical barriers to structural problems

### Conclusion (Already Corrected)

**Established standard:** Leads with contribution, acknowledges empirical test limitations as methodological note, uses appropriately modest language throughout
