# 5.1 Paper Prompt Development Log 

INPUTS:
[epistemic-trace] - "Epistemic Trace: Original Text for Final Synthesis"
Contains original conversation text with privacy-preserving elisions
Source material for synthesis
[paper-prompt] - command to write prompt for paper on AI-assisted scholarship journal based on the epistemic trace
Main prompt for paper generation
Synthesizes epistemic trace into actionable writing instructions

Modification Log
PDL-001: COHERENCE FIX - Disclosure Timing
Date: Current session
 Issue: Incoherence between two sections:
Section "Mandatory Prompt Disclosure Upon Acceptance" → prompts provided AFTER acceptance
Section "Proposed Review Mechanism" → submission includes prompts BEFORE review
Analysis: Drawing from two different reasoning stages in [epistemic-trace]. Later development (dual submission) overrides earlier idea (post-acceptance disclosure).
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt]
Removed "Mandatory Prompt Disclosure Upon Acceptance" section
Replaced with "Signal Discontinuity + Full Methodological Transparency"
Review mechanism now consistently describes dual submission (paper + disclosure submitted together)
Split review process maintained: Reviewer A sees paper only, Reviewer B sees disclosure only initially
Rationale: Later reasoning in conversation supersedes earlier proposals. Dual submission model is final design.

MOD-002: METHODOLOGY SECTION REVISION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Methodology section should describe the iterative prompt refinement process (what is happening in the current dialogue) in generic terms, not detail the dual submission format
Clarification: The paper's methodology section needs to describe:
Paper written through iterative AI-assisted dialogue
Prompts extracted from prior conversation and refined
Coherence checking between prompt and synthesis
Systematic tracking of modifications
Generic description without textual details of this specific process
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt] methodology section
Added guidance to describe iterative prompt development process generically
Clarified that detailed textual exposition of this refinement process is not interesting
Focus on demonstrating transparency about the actual process used to write THIS paper
Rationale: Methodology should show what full transparency looks like by describing the actual process used, but procedurally rather than with blow-by-blow detail.

PDL-003: POSITIVE MOTIVATIONS ADDED
Date: Current session
 Issue: Paper currently emphasizes negative arguments (what bad things the journal prevents). Needs positive reasons why scholars should be interested in AI-assisted scholarship artifacts.
Relevance Assessment: RELEVANT - Essential to paper's economy. The paper argues for creating a new venue; it needs both critique of current system AND affirmative case for why scholars would want to participate. Makes the journal intellectually valuable, not just a workaround.
Resolution: Added new section to [paper-prompt] titled "Why Scholars Should Engage with AI-Assisted Scholarship"
Content added:
Explorative knowledge motivated by wonder at AI capabilities (classical philosophical theme)
A posteriori knowledge valued alongside a priori (Quine, pragmatist tradition)
Philosophy of technology: creativity and tool usage
General level: Technology as medium of creativity, not just shortcut (Byrne on music, Wheeler's philosophical analysis)
Specific level: Analogy between music synthesizers and distant writing (Floridi)
Two reference lists created as requested:
List A: References with full details provided
List B: Suggestions based on vague pointers (to be verified)
Rationale: Provides affirmative intellectual motivation. Grounds project in established philosophical traditions. Answers "why participate?" not just "why current system fails."

PDL-004: STRUCTURAL REVISIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS
Date: Current session
 Issue: Multiple structural and conceptual clarifications needed for coherence and precision
Changes implemented:
4a. Meta-argument repositioned
Moved editor/reviewer bias argument from methodology section into main paper content
Now part of negative arguments section under heading "Unfair Reviews"
Rationale: This is substantive critique of current system, not just methodology note
4b. "Journal" definition clarified
Specified "distinct journal" means broadly: can be track within existing journal
Essential feature: special review track with distinct requirements
Not necessarily standalone publication
4c. Goal specification added
Clarified purpose is producing valuable knowledge (process and outcome)
NOT rewarding individual merit
This distinguishes venue from credential-granting function of traditional publishing
4d. Reproduction requirement elaborated
Added detailed discussion of why Reviewer B reproduces paper from prompts
Two reasons specified:
Reason 1: Sufficiency test
Determines if author input sufficient to generate advancement valued by review (minus details)
Metaphors provided: information compression/unzipping; biological (seed/soil - author input as seed, LLM as compressed human discourse)
Request for analytic philosophy appropriate metaphor
Reason 2: Authorship anchoring
Shows author responsible through meaningful control, not mere endorsement
Author controls "difference that makes the difference" (the right difference)
Distinguishes from chance or passive acceptance
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt] with all above changes integrated throughout appropriate sections
Rationale: Makes argument structure clearer, defines key terms precisely, explicates the philosophical significance of the reproduction mechanism.

PDL-005: FIX COMPONENT STRUCTURE
Date: Current session
 Issue: "Two Components" section has repetition - Component 2 includes elements of Component 1, making them not truly distinct
Resolution: Restructured [paper-prompt] to separate components cleanly:
Component 1: Signal Discontinuity (venue positioning, independence from prestige system)
Component 2: Mandatory Full Methodological Transparency (dual submission requirement)
Rationale: The two components are distinct mechanisms that work together - one about the venue's relationship to traditional prestige economy, the other about submission requirements. They should not overlap.

PDL-006: BIBLIOGRAPHIC DETAILS AND RELEVANCE ASSESSMENTS
Date: Current session
 Issue: Need complete bibliographic details for Floridi paper and relevance assessment for Dewey and James references
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt] Reference Lists with:
Floridi paper (List A):
Full citation: Floridi, L. (2025). "Distant Writing: Literary Production in the Age of Artificial Intelligence." Centre for Digital Ethics (CEDE) Research Paper. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5232088
Key concepts: Authors as "meta-authors" designing narratives; LLMs performing writing; "wrAIting"; boundless narrative isotropy; expansion (not replacement) of human creativity within design paradigm
Dewey - Experience and Nature (List B with relevance assessment):
Dewey, J. (1925). Experience and Nature. Chicago: Open Court
Relevance: 75% - Core argument about continuity between experience and nature; rejection of sharp separation between philosophical and empirical inquiry; inquiry as response to problems in practice; empirical naturalism
Most relevant sections: Chapters on philosophical method, nature of inquiry, relationship between theory and practice
Key idea for paper: A priori speculation fruitful insofar as it guides exploration of reality and generates empirical knowledge
James - Pragmatism (List B with relevance assessment):
James, W. (1907). Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking. New York: Longman Green and Co.
Relevance: 65% - Truth as verification process; practical consequences as test; "truth happens to an idea" through verification; truth as what "works" in guiding successful action
Most relevant: Lecture 6 ("Pragmatism's Conception of Truth"); preface to The Meaning of Truth (1909)
Key idea for paper: Truth not static property but process of verification; beliefs validated through practical utility in inquiry and action
Rationale: Provides complete scholarly apparatus; relevance percentages guide which aspects to emphasize in paper; identifies specific sections most pertinent to AI-assisted scholarship argument.

PDL-007: DISCONTINUITY JUSTIFICATION STRENGTHENED
Date: Current session
 Issue: Need to clarify why signal discontinuity is necessary given that procedural safeguards (reproduction test) could detect manipulation even in traditional venues
New artifact created: [discontinuity-discussion] - Full text of discussion about whether discontinuity is needed
Key insight from discussion: Discontinuity is necessary not because procedures are insufficient, but because participant selection matters. Current assessment: ~15-20% intrinsic motivation in academic population. Without discontinuity, credential-seekers (80%) would overwhelm methodology-focused scholars (20%), creating bad-faith submissions that burden review process even if eventually detectable.
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt] to:
Strengthen justification for discontinuity based on participant selection rather than procedural inadequacy
Frame discontinuity as potentially temporary/strategic (establish community first, then potentially integrate with traditional venues)
Add empirical assessment of current motivational landscape in academia (precarity, stigma, risk asymmetry)
Clarify that procedures COULD work in traditional venues but cultural safeguard needed initially
Rationale: Makes the argument for discontinuity more sophisticated - not claiming procedures fail, but recognizing community selection effects matter for establishing norms. Provides empirical grounding in current academic incentive structures.

PDL-008: METHODOLOGY LOCATION AND DISCLOSURE STRUCTURE
Date: Current session
 Issue: Where should AI assistance methodology be disclosed in the paper to comply with philosophy journal requirements while maintaining full transparency?
Discussion summary: Philosophy journals don't typically have Methods sections. Options considered: footnote, author note, acknowledgments, separate section, supplementary materials. Concluded that this paper cannot afford strategically minimal disclosure - it's the test case for the entire argument.
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt] to specify:
1. Preliminary Note (before main argument):
Direct statement of AI assistance
Generic procedural description (prompts extracted, synthesized, coherence checked, iteratively refined)
Honest assessment of degree of involvement
Reference to supplementary materials
Brief justification that this models what paper advocates
2. Supplementary Materials contain:
Full prompt ([paper-prompt] artifact)
Key dialogue excerpts showing argument development
Epistemic trace ([epistemic-trace] artifact)
Discontinuity discussion ([discontinuity-discussion] artifact)
Modification tracker ([prompt-tracker] artifact)
Rationale:
Paper's credibility depends on maximum transparency - anything less is hypocritical
Preliminary note models the behavior being proposed
Demonstrates what submission to proposed venue would look like
The disclosure IS part of the argument, not defensive add-on
Full honesty makes this the experimental test case: if rejected for disclosure rather than argument quality → proves thesis

PDL-009: COMPLETE PROMPT REWRITE
Date: Current session
 Issue: Paper structure section in [paper-prompt] still reflected old format despite all previous modifications. Need clean rewrite incorporating all PDL changes.
New artifact created: [paper-prompt-v2] - "Complete Prompt: AI-Assisted Scholarship Paper (Final Version)"
Comprehensive rewrite includes all previous modifications:
PDL-001: Dual submission model (not post-acceptance disclosure)
PDL-002: Methodology as iterative prompt development
PDL-003: Positive motivations (wonder, pragmatism, creativity/tools, methodological contribution)
PDL-004: Meta-argument repositioned to "Unfair Reviews"; journal broadly defined; goal specification; reproduction requirement with two purposes
PDL-005: Two components cleanly separated (no repetition)
PDL-006: Complete bibliographic details with relevance assessments (Floridi, Dewey 75%, James 65%)
PDL-007: Sophisticated discontinuity justification (participant selection, 15-20% intrinsic motivation estimate, strategic/temporary)
PDL-008: Preliminary Note + Supplementary Materials structure
New paper structure (11 sections):
Preliminary Note (full disclosure)
Introduction (problem statement)
Incentives Analysis
Why Contiguous Approaches Fail
The Problem of Unfair Reviews (meta-test case)
Positive Motivations (four reasons)
Proposed Solution - Component 1 (discontinuity)
Proposed Solution - Component 2 (transparency)
Review Mechanism (split review, reproduction purposes)
Conclusion
References
Rationale: Clean slate ensures all modifications properly integrated; paper structure now correctly reflects all discussions; provides coherent final prompt for paper generation.

PDL-010: INTRODUCTION RESEARCH AND CONTEXTUALIZATION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Introduction needs to situate paper within current debates about AI and academic writing in philosophy; must establish competing camps and identify gaps
New artifact created: [intro-research] - "Introduction Research: Current Debate on AI and Academic Writing"
Research conducted on:
Daily Nous discussions showing competing camps in philosophy
Current journal policies on AI authorship (Elsevier, ACM, Science journals, etc.)
Philosophical arguments about AI authorship (conservative view, Floridi's distant writing)
Key tensions and gaps in current debate
Competing camps identified:
Camp 1 (AI as threat): Jollimore, Berg, Rini - focus on student cheating, "subcognitive" concerns
Camp 2 (AI as tool): Ontiveros & Clay - potential to revolutionize philosophy if properly developed
Camp 3 (Moderate): "Delegated writing" framework, anti-AI-exceptionalism
Key tensions identified:
Demand for disclosure vs. penalty for disclosure
Collaborative production vs. individual authorship model
Process transparency vs. outcome evaluation
"As if" sufficiency vs. genuine responsibility
Critical gaps not addressed by current debate:
No venue for fully disclosed substantial AI-assisted work
No positive case for AI-assisted scholarship (all defensive)
Binary framing (author vs. tool) - no distributed authorship frameworks
No mechanism for verifying disclosed AI involvement
Proposed introduction structure:
Open with Floridi's "distant writing" as illustration
Set stage with Daily Nous "Two Cultures" debate
Identify paradox: transparency required but penalized
Show missing infrastructure
Position this paper's intervention
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt-v2] to incorporate:
New introduction section with current debate framing
Citations to Daily Nous discussions, journal policy studies, Floridi
Identification of structural problem this paper addresses
Clear positioning against both "camps" (proposing infrastructure, not taking sides)
Rationale: Grounds paper in live debates; demonstrates understanding of current landscape; identifies genuine gap that paper fills; avoids appearing to argue in vacuum.

PDL-011: REFERENCE LIST ORGANIZATION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Daily Nous sources and journal policy studies need verification before being treated as confirmed references
Resolution: Moved to List B (To Be Verified):
All Daily Nous sources (Jollimore, Rini, Berg, Ontiveros & Clay, Two Cultures post)
Journal policy studies (Lund & Naheem, Hosseini et al.)
Philosophical analysis (Conservative View paper)
List A now contains only:
Byrne (How Music Works)
Wheeler (Embodied/Extended Mind)
Floridi (Distant Writing)
Rationale: User needs to verify Daily Nous references before finalizing; List B clearly indicates what requires verification before paper submission.

PDL-012: COMPLETE CITATION INFORMATION FOR KEY SOURCES
Date: Current session
 Issue: Need precise citations with links for Jollimore and Rini articles referenced in introduction
Research completed:
Jollimore article:
Full citation: Jollimore, T. (2025, March 5). "I Used to Teach Students. Now I Catch ChatGPT Cheats." The Walrus. https://thewalrus.ca/i-used-to-teach-students-now-i-catch-chatgpt-cheats/
Daily Nous discussion: March 7, 2025. https://dailynous.com/2025/03/07/a-philosophers-reflections-on-teaching-in-a-world-with-ai/
Jollimore is philosopher and poet at California State University, Chico
Rini article:
Full citation: Rini, R. (2025, January 2). "Chatbottery." Afterthoughts column, The Times Literary Supplement. https://www.the-tls.com/regular-features/afterthoughts/chatbottery-afterthoughts-regina-rini
Daily Nous discussion: January 9, 2025. https://dailynous.com/2025/01/09/teaching-writing-in-the-ai-era/
Rini is Associate Professor of Philosophy at York University, Toronto; holds Canada Research Chair in Social Reasoning; writes regular "Morals of the Story"/"Afterthoughts" column for TLS
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt-v2] and [intro-research] with complete citations including direct links to both original sources and Daily Nous discussions
Rationale: Provides verifiable sources; readers can access both original articles and philosophical community discussion; strengthens introduction's empirical grounding.

PDL-013: REFERENCE VERIFICATION AND MAJOR ARGUMENT INTEGRATION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Complete verification of List B references; integration of central Deweyan argument; addition of accountability framework
New artifact created: [reference-verification] - Complete verification process and decisions for all List B references
Verification Results:
Teaching-focused sources (limited relevance):
Jollimore (2025) - VERIFIED but not directly relevant (training vs. execution distinction)
Rini (2025) - VERIFIED via publicly accessible text; limited relevance (teaching focus)
Berg/Robbins debate - VERIFIED; learning focus, outside scope
Decision: Acknowledge but clarify paper legitimately brackets teaching/learning issues
AI tool sources (different scope):
Ontiveros & Clay (2021) - READ; specialized AI tools, different scope
Two Cultures post - VERIFIED; use for debate framing
Authorship policy sources:
Lund & Naheem (2023) - VERIFIED abstract; assume consensus view (AI can't be author)
Hosseini et al. (2023) - READ; HIGHLY RELEVANT for accountability argument
Van Woudenberg et al. (2024) - VERIFIED; conservative view we assume as premise
Philosophical sources:
Dewey (1925) - EXTENSIVELY VERIFIED via ChatGPT pointers + human selection
Edition specified: https://archive.org/details/experienceandnat029343mbp
Key passages: Ch. 1, pp. 31-35 on feedback loop criticism
Floridi Agency paper - FOUND both SSRN and published versions; use 2025 published
Classical sources (Plato, Aristotle) - VERIFIED
Deletions:
James Pragmatism - REMOVED (not needed)
Quine "Two Dogmas" - REMOVED (use "Epistemology Naturalized" instead)
Clark Cyborgs - REMOVED (use "Extended Mind" paper instead)
Major Additions to Prompt:
1. Central Deweyan Argument (new subsection in "Positive Motivations"):
Philosophical debate about AI/intelligence/agency exists (cite Floridi 2025b)
Dewey's criticism: philosophers lack feedback loop to ordinary experience
This venue enables "experiments of life" not just controlled experiments
Philosophizing central to human self-definition → requires extensive exploration
High costs require collaborative structure
This is CENTRAL positive argument for the journal
2. Accountability Framework (new subsection 4 in "Positive Motivations"):
Addresses Hosseini et al. accuracy concerns
LLMs can be inaccurate (like humans)
Cure is accountability at two levels:
Human author commitment (necessary condition for submission)
Structured review process (second line of defense)
Goal is producing valid work, not data
Standards apply equally to AI-assisted and human-written work
3. Human Commitment Requirement:
Added to Component 2 (Submission Requirements)
"A necessary (though not sufficient) condition for submission is the author's commitment to stand behind the full textual result"
Author must treat every claim as if they had written it themselves
4. Updated Reference Lists:
List A expanded with verified sources:
Added: Floridi (2025b) Agency paper
Added: Dewey (1925) with specific edition and pages
Added: Van Woudenberg et al. (2024)
Added: Hosseini et al. (2023)
Added: Plato and Aristotle
List B reorganized with usage notes:
Each source marked with "Use:" instructions
Teaching-focused sources flagged for limited connection
Deletions documented
5. Paper Structure Updated:
Section 6 now includes Deweyan argument as part of positive motivations
Accountability framework integrated into section 6
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt-v2] with all changes; created [reference-verification] artifact; documented in tracker
Rationale:
Verification ensures scholarly rigor
Deweyan argument provides philosophical grounding for "experiments of life" approach
Accountability framework directly addresses most serious objection (accuracy/reliability)
Human commitment requirement establishes clear responsibility
Makes positive case much stronger while addressing concerns

PDL-014: REMOVE EMPIRICAL CLAIMS REQUIRING DIFFICULT VALIDATION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Discontinuity justification section contained specific empirical claims (dates, percentages) that would be difficult to cite/validate
Removed:
Specific date: "2025"
Specific percentage: "15-20% intrinsic motivation"
Specific percentage: "80% credential-seekers"
Temporal specificity that dates the argument
Retained:
Core message about academic context
General characterization of incentive landscape
Logic of argument (credential-seeking would overwhelm methodology-focused scholars)
Note that this situation has persisted and isn't changing soon
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt-v2] Component 1 discontinuity justification with more general language
Rationale: Avoids need to cite specific studies for numbers; keeps argument valid without empirical validation burden; makes claim more timeless rather than dated to specific year

PDL-015: WRITING METHODOLOGY RECOMMENDATION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Need strategy for writing full paper given Claude Sonnet 4.5 context window limitations
RECOMMENDED WRITING METHODOLOGY
Context Window Constraints
Claude Sonnet 4.5 has ~190k token context window
Full paper prompt + artifact generation will approach limits
Need strategic approach for multi-section paper
Recommended Approach: Section-by-Section Generation
Phase 1: Preliminary Note (First Chat)
Start new chat with full [paper-prompt-v2]
Request ONLY Preliminary Note section
This tests methodology disclosure while staying within context
Save output, evaluate, iterate if needed
Phase 2: Introduction (New Chat)
Start fresh chat
Provide:
Full [paper-prompt-v2]
Summary of Preliminary Note decisions (not full text)
Request ONLY Introduction section
Reference debate framing, paradox, gaps identified in intro-research
Save output
Phase 3: Main Argument Sections (New Chats) For each major section (3-9 in structure):
Start fresh chat
Provide:
Full [paper-prompt-v2]
Brief summaries of completed sections (key claims only, not full text)
Specific request: "Write Section X"
This keeps context manageable while maintaining coherence
Strategic Use of Summaries:
What to summarize:
Previously written sections (2-3 sentence summaries of key claims)
"So far we've established: [bullet points]"
Transitions needed: "This section needs to connect to..."
What to include in full:
The complete [paper-prompt-v2] (always)
Specific quotes/passages being referenced in current section
References being cited in current section
Phase 4: Assembly and Coherence Check (New Chat)
Combine all sections
Start fresh chat with:
Full paper draft
[paper-prompt-v2] for checking against requirements
Request: "Check this paper for internal coherence, transitions, and compliance with prompt requirements"
Identify gaps, redundancies, missing connections
Phase 5: Final Polish (New Chat if needed)
If major revisions needed, fresh chat with:
Revised draft
Specific issues to address
If minor, continue in coherence check chat
Alternative: Artifact-First Approach
If full paper generation in one go:
Start with full [paper-prompt-v2]
Request: "Generate complete paper following this prompt"
Claude will create artifact with full paper
Use subsequent chat space for revisions
Advantages:
Sees full structure at once
Better internal consistency
Fewer assembly issues
Disadvantages:
May hit context limits
Less control over individual sections
Harder to iterate on specific parts
Recommended Choice: Section-by-Section with Final Assembly
Rationale:
More control over each argument
Can iterate on difficult sections without regenerating entire paper
Avoids context limit issues
Maintains connection to prompt requirements throughout
Final assembly pass ensures coherence
Critical Artifacts to Have Ready:
[paper-prompt-v2] - The complete prompt (THIS MUST BE IN EVERY CHAT)
[epistemic-trace] - For methodology section reference
[discontinuity-discussion] - For supplementary materials
[prompt-tracker] - For methodology documentation
[intro-research] - For introduction context
[reference-verification] - For proper citations
Workflow Summary:
Chat 1: Preliminary Note only
Chat 2: Introduction only (with PN summary)
Chat 3: Incentives Analysis (with PN + Intro summaries)
Chat 4: Contiguous Approaches Fail (with summaries)
Chat 5: Unfair Reviews (with summaries)
Chat 6: Positive Motivations (with summaries)
Chat 7: Solution Component 1 (with summaries)
Chat 8: Solution Component 2 (with summaries)
Chat 9: Review Mechanism (with summaries)
Chat 10: Conclusion (with summaries)
Chat 11: Full assembly + coherence check
Chat 12 (if needed): Final revisions

Each chat includes:
Full [paper-prompt-v2]
Summaries of completed sections (not full text)
Request for specific section
This approach maximizes control while managing context efficiently.
Rationale: Systematic section-by-section approach with strategic summarization allows full paper generation within context constraints while maintaining coherence and prompt alignment throughout process.

PDL-016: SUBMISSION MATERIALS ORGANIZATION
Date: Current session
 Issue: Need clear organization of all artifacts for actual submission to journals
New artifact created: [submission-organization] - Complete guide to organizing materials for submission
Organization Structure:
CATEGORY A: Main Paper File
Preliminary Note + Paper Body + References
Single file for submission
CATEGORY B: Supplementary Materials (ALL SUBMITTED)
B1: [paper-prompt-v2] - Full prompt showing author direction
B2: [epistemic-trace] - Original conversation showing idea development
B3: [discontinuity-discussion] - Key reasoning about venue design
B4: [prompt-tracker] - Iterative refinement documentation
CATEGORY C: Internal Development Materials (NOT SUBMITTED)
C1: [intro-research] - Background research notes
C2: [reference-verification] - Internal quality control
These are writing tools, not methodological disclosure
CATEGORY D: Optional Additional Context
Brief methodology overview if journal requests
Key Decisions:
Supplementary materials are REQUIRED, not optional


They ARE the methodological disclosure the paper argues for
Essential to paper's integrity and argument
Not submitting them would be hypocritical
Internal materials stay internal


Research notes and verification processes are quality control
Not part of transparency requirement
Final paper incorporates relevant findings
File naming conventions established


Professional, consistent naming scheme
Makes materials easy to identify and organize
Hosting recommendations provided


OSF (Open Science Framework) preferred
Institutional repository alternative
Ensures long-term availability with DOI
Anonymization guidance included


For blind peer review
What to remove from main paper and supplements
How to restore after acceptance
Additional Components:
Submission checklist (traditional journals vs. proposed journal)
Supplementary materials introduction template
Summary table showing submit/don't submit decisions
Final recommendations for submission workflow
Resolution: Created [submission-organization] artifact with complete guidance
Rationale:
Provides clear roadmap from development to submission
Ensures methodological disclosure is complete and professional
Distinguishes between transparency requirements and internal process
Makes submission process straightforward when paper is complete
Anticipates both traditional journal and proposed journal submission scenarios

PDL-017: METHODOLOGY, STYLE, AND EPISTEMIC TRACE CLARIFICATIONS
Date: Current session
 Issue: Multiple final clarifications needed before writing begins
Changes to [paper-prompt-v2]:
1. Preliminary Note - Added epistemic trace justification:
New paragraph (point 4) added explaining:
Philosophical ideas don't arise linearly or only at computer
Epistemic trace is REDACTED from longer conversation
Longer conversation included personal elements and tangential discussions
Natural ideation stream: publisher practices → journal idea → paper about journal idea
Paper itself illustrates problem journal would solve
Full tracking impossible/unnecessary
Epistemic trace captures philosophically relevant development
Rationale: Reviewers need to understand what the epistemic trace artifact represents and why it's not a complete record of every thought.
2. Writing process clarification:
Added note: "The Preliminary Note (including the methodology description) should be written AFTER the modification tracker is complete, as it documents the iterative process that the methodology describes."
Implication: PDL-015 workflow needs adjustment - Preliminary Note should be written LAST or near-last, not first.
Revised workflow recommendation:
Write main paper body sections first (Intro through Conclusion)
Complete all modifications and track them
THEN write Preliminary Note with modification tracker available for reference
This allows accurate description of the actual process that occurred
3. Style requirements - Three additions:
a. LLM idiosyncrasies acknowledgment:
Paper should abstract from typical LLM stylistic patterns
These carry stigma due to association with "AI slop"
Reviewers should try to evaluate arguments on merit, not stylistic tells
But some patterns must be avoided...
b. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION added: "Never use the construction 'it's not just that... it's that...' or any close variants"
This rhetorical device overused by LLMs
Must not appear EVEN ONCE in paper
No variants like "it's not only that... it's that..." or "the problem isn't just... it's..."
c. Voice consistency requirement:
Use author's natural voice, not generic LLM voice
Reference human-authored portions of epistemic trace to calibrate style
Goal: paper should sound like specific individual, not generic AI output
Important for analytic philosophy where content > style, but voice homogeneity is concerning
Demonstrates AI assistance need not mean voice homogenization
Implementation note: When writing paper, include instruction to "analyze the human-authored portions of [epistemic-trace] for the author's characteristic style, vocabulary, sentence structure, and argumentative patterns, then write in that voice."
4. Analytic philosophy framing:
Added note clarifying:
Author in analytic philosophy tradition
Content matters more than literary style
However, voice homogeneity across AI-assisted papers is problem
Paper should demonstrate AI assistance compatible with individual voice
Resolution: Updated [paper-prompt-v2] with all additions
Rationale:
Epistemic trace justification: Prevents misunderstanding about what constitutes adequate transparency (complete recording impossible/unnecessary)
Methodology timing: Writing Preliminary Note last ensures accurate description of actual process
Style prohibitions: Prevents most jarring LLM tells while acknowledging others may remain
Voice calibration: Addresses serious concern about AI leading to voice homogenization in academic writing
Analytic philosophy context: Situates style concerns appropriately within philosophical tradition
Critical for writing process:
Epistemic trace must be available during writing (for voice calibration)
Modification tracker must be complete before writing Preliminary Note
Every section must be checked for "it's not just that... it's that" construction (forbidden)

UPDATED PDL-015: REVISED WRITING METHODOLOGY
Original recommendation: Write Preliminary Note first Revised recommendation: Write Preliminary Note LAST (or near-last)
Revised workflow:
Chat 1: Introduction (with full prompt)
Chat 2: Incentives Analysis (with Intro summary)
Chat 3: Contiguous Approaches Fail (with summaries)
Chat 4: Unfair Reviews (with summaries)
Chat 5: Positive Motivations (with summaries)
Chat 6: Solution Component 1 (with summaries)
Chat 7: Solution Component 2 (with summaries)
Chat 8: Review Mechanism (with summaries)
Chat 9: Conclusion (with summaries)
Chat 10: Preliminary Note (with access to completed prompt-tracker)
Chat 11: Full assembly + coherence check
Chat 12 (if needed): Final revisions + "it's not just that" check

Each chat includes:
Full [paper-prompt-v2]
[epistemic-trace] for voice calibration
Summaries of completed sections (not full text)
MODIFICATION TRACKER (Current: PDL-017): [Either full tracker or recent PDLs only] 
Additional references
Request for specific section
Chat 10 specifically includes:
Full [paper-prompt-v2]
[prompt-tracker] artifact (complete with all PDL entries)
Summary of what paper argued
Request for Preliminary Note that accurately describes the process
Final check (Chat 12):
Search entire paper for forbidden construction
Verify no instances of "it's not just that... it's that" or variants
Check voice consistency throughout
Ensure all sections sound like same author (the actual author)
Rationale: Writing Preliminary Note last ensures it accurately describes the actual iterative process that occurred, documented in the completed modification tracker.
