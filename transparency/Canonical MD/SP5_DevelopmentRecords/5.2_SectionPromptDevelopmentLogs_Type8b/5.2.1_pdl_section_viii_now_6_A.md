# 5.2.1 Prompt Development Log: Section VIII [now 6] Guidance (A-4.4.4)

# Prompt Development Log: Section 8 Guidance

  

**DOCUMENT TYPE: Type 8 - Prompt Development Log (Section-Level)**

  

**Date:** October 19, 2025  

**Scope:** Development of Section Guidance for Section 8 (Review Mechanism)  

**Final Output:** Section Guidance 4.4.3

  

---

  

## PDL-001: Initial Structure Identified

  

**Issue:** Early draft guidance existed but lacked clear structure and appropriate abstraction level

  

**Decision:** Establish three-tier structure:

- Section 8 (main body): Conceptual, ~1,200-1,500 words

- Appendix A: Detailed but not prescriptive, ~3,000-4,000 words  

- Supplementary materials: Actual artifacts

  

**Rationale:** Match abstraction level to audience - philosophers evaluate concept, implementers assess plausibility, reviewers use materials

  

---

  

## PDL-002: Core Principle Articulated

  

**Issue:** Need to connect Section 8 to overall paper argument

  

**Decision:** Lead with "Core Principle: The Paper Embodies Its Own Argument"

- Section 2: Prompts alone enable underreporting

- Section 3: Contiguous venues inherit problem

- Section 4: Even willing scholars face barriers

- Solution: Prompts + process documentation (A+B) = resistant to gaming

- This paper demonstrates its own proposal

  

**Rationale:** Meta-consistency - the section about documentation methodology should explicitly state that the paper demonstrates what it proposes

  

---

  

## PDL-003: Removed Over-Specification

  

**Issue:** Initial draft included too much technical detail (full Reproduction Package structure, preprocessing prompts, detailed reviewer checklists)

  

**Decision:**

- Remove: Six-section structure details, preprocessing technical specs, step-by-step reviewer instructions

- Keep: High-level Reproduction Package concept, types of process documentation (list and brief explanation), two purposes (sufficiency + authorship)

  

**Rationale:** User feedback: "this is still too complex" - Section 8 must be conceptual, NOT technical specification. Philosophy paper, not engineering document.

  

---

  

## PDL-004: Added "What NOT to Include"

  

**Issue:** Risk of over-specification remained

  

**Decision:** Explicit negative guidance added:

- NOT full Reproduction Package structure (6 sections)

- NOT preprocessing prompts

- NOT step-by-step reviewer instructions  

- NOT technical details of generation

  

**Rationale:** Prescriptive boundaries prevent reverting to over-specification during writing

  

---

  

## PDL-005: Process Documentation Types Clarified

  

**Issue:** Need to explain what's documented without overwhelming detail

  

**Decision:** List and briefly explain types of process documentation:

- Modification Logs (what changed and why)

- Pattern Summaries (generalizable lessons)

- Section Guidance (instructions for each section)

- Section Summaries (argument flow)

- Epistemic Traces (verbatim excerpts from exploratory conversations, dual purpose: documentation + tone/style preservation)

- Session Prompts (optional continuity mechanisms)

  

**Rationale:** Show diversity of materials without full technical specification. Enough for philosopher to understand scope.

  

---

  

## PDL-006: Target Lengths Specified

  

**Issue:** Risk of section bloating without clear boundaries

  

**Decision:** Explicit word counts:

- Section 8: ~1,200-1,500 words

- Appendix A: ~3,000-4,000 words

- Section 9: ~1,000 words

  

**Rationale:** Constraints maintain appropriate abstraction level. Forces concision.

  

---

  

## PDL-007: Success Criteria Added

  

**Issue:** Need clear evaluation framework

  

**Decision:** Added verification checklist:

- Split-review architecture clear?

- Reproduction concept understandable?

- Two purposes explained?

- Connected to Sections 2 and 7?

- High-level enough (not over-specified)?

- Detailed enough (credible and evaluable)?

- References Appendix appropriately?

- Maintains philosophical tone?

  

**Rationale:** Self-assessment tool prevents drift during drafting

  

---

  

## PDL-008: Appendix Structure Integrated

  

**Issue:** Section 8 guidance needed to show relationship with Appendix A

  

**Decision:** Added Appendix structure showing:

- A.1: Overview (same as before)

- A.2: Document Creation Flow (NEW - chronological/causal relationships)

- A.3: 11 Document Types (organized by phase)

- A.4-A.9: Existing structure maintained

  

**Rationale:** Appendix should show temporal/causal flow, not just static list. This guides Section 8 to properly reference what Appendix will contain.

  

---

  

## PDL-009: Cross-Reference Framework Established

  

**Issue:** How should Section 8 reference other sections and Appendix?

  

**Decision:** Explicit reference strategy:

- Callback to Section 2 (incentive argument)

- Connection to Section 7 (mandatory transparency)

- Forward to Appendix A ("provides additional detail")

- Use SP-X nomenclature consistently

  

**Rationale:** Section 8 is node in network - must connect backward, forward, and downward (to Appendix)

  

---

  

## PDL-010: Category Prohibition Applied

  

**Issue:** Risk of adding unnecessary document types in explanations

  

**Decision:** Enforce 11-type limit. When explaining process documentation, list existing types only. No new categories.

  

**Rationale:** User principle: "There is a prohibition to add entities or categories." This guidance must enforce that constraint.

  

---

  

## PDL-011: Tone Requirements Clarified

  

**Issue:** Balance between philosophical rigor and accessibility

  

**Decision:** Specify tone explicitly:

- Maintain philosophical tone (NOT technical specification)

- Use flowing prose (NO bullet points in body text)

- Conceptual explanation, not procedural manual

- Acknowledge limitations honestly

  

**Rationale:** Philosophy paper proposing infrastructure requires philosophical voice, not engineering voice

  

---

  

## PDL-012: Final Consolidation

  

**Issue:** Multiple guidance fragments needed integration

  

**Decision:** Consolidate into single Section Guidance document (4.4.3) with:

- Core Principle (paper embodies argument)

- Purpose (split-review system, conceptual level)

- Target Length (~1,200-1,500 words)

- Structure (6 parts: Architecture, Task, What Reproduction Means, Purposes, Concerns, Connection)

- Key Points (what to include, what NOT to include)

- Success Criteria

  

**Rationale:** Single comprehensive document prevents scattered guidance and ensures completeness

  

---

  

## Summary

  

**Refinement arc:**

- FROM: Scattered thoughts, risk of over-specification

- THROUGH: Simplification, explicit boundaries, appropriate abstraction

- TO: Clear conceptual guidance with success criteria

  

**Key principle applied:** "this is still too complex" → ruthless simplification

  

**Final output:** Section Guidance 4.4.3 for writing Section 8 at appropriate conceptual level
