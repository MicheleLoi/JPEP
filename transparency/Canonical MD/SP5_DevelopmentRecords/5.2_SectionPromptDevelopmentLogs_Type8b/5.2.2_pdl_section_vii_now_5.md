# 5.2.2 Prompt Development Log: Section VII [now 5: "Signalling Discontinuity"]  Guidance

# Prompt Development Log: Section 7 Guidance

  

**Document Type:** Type 2b - Prompt Development Log (Section-Level)

**Section:** VII - Strategic Discontinuity: Design Principles  

**Date:** October 14, 2025

**Status:** Complete

**Final Output:** SectionGuidance_Section7.md

  

---

  

## Overview

  

This log documents the iterative development of Section 7 Guidance through dialogue. Section 7 needed to specify what "discontinuity" means practically and introduce design principles that implement Section VI's strategic positioning.

  

**Context at start:**

- Sections I-VI complete

- Section VI established transformation dynamics (4 mechanisms)

- Section VI concluded with "strategic positioning" accepting short-term marginality

- Need: Section 7 guidance to operationalize this

  

**Challenge:** Initial attempts framed discontinuity defensively ("prevent gaming") rather than constructively ("enable good faith participants").

  

---

  

## Development Process

  

### Inputs

- Complete Prompt (comprehensive project framing)

- Pattern Summaries from Sections I-V

- Section Summaries (especially Section VI)

- Section Guidance examples from earlier sections

  

### Initial User Request

"Deriving your context from the complete prompt, can you write the guidance for writing section 7"

  

---

  

## Iterative Refinements

  

### PDL-001: Defensive to Constructive Framing

**Issue identified:** Initial guidance framed discontinuity defensively:

- "Why discontinuity if procedures work?" (assumes gaming resistance primary)

- Positioned discontinuity as preventing bad actors

- Missed paper's good faith orientation (Pattern Summary - Methodology Design)

  

**User correction:**

"Read carefully the other two documents to determine whether the intention is to propose a form of tracking that be difficult to game. Also highlight the importance of this requisite: ecological validity. Invert the narrative: we already have sufficient motivation for a good faith approach and discontinuity from section 5 and 6. The point is to illustrate the kind of institution and procedures that can be built given these."

  

**Resolution:**

- Inverted narrative: start from motivated participants (given) → ask what infrastructure optimizes for them

- Frame as implementing Section VI's strategic positioning

- Constructive specification, not defensive justification

  

**Impact:** Fundamental reorientation of entire guidance document

  

---

  

### PDL-002: Ecological Validity as Design Principle

**What added:** Ecological validity as first of three design principles

  

**Definition:** Procedures that work in actual scholarly practice and enable genuine methodological learning, not theoretical abstractions or surveillance bureaucracy

  

**Rationale:**

- Explains what discontinuity enables (not just prevents)

- Shows value proposition for good faith participants

- Connects to Section VI's positive feedback loops

- Section VII's original contribution

  

**Application:**

- Procedures fit transparent scholars' actual work

- Enable learning about AI-assisted methodology

- Generate knowledge for community calibration

- Rich enough for verification AND contribution

  

---

  

### PDL-003: Cost Structure Principle

**What added:** Cost structure as second design principle

  

**Principle:** Fabricating plausible documentation generally more cognitively/temporally costly than generating honestly through actual work

  

**User insight:** "The element promoting (not guaranteeing) tracking honesty is the development of tracking system such that to invent it is generally more costly than to develop it originally."

  

**Rationale:**

- Not about catching cheaters, but making honesty path of least resistance

- Economic/cognitive incentives align with transparency

- Completes good faith orientation

  

**Connection to paper:**

- Section II: Prompts alone (A) = gameable

- Sections VIII-IX: Prompts + process (A+B) = fabrication more costly than honesty

- Example: Fabricating coherent Epistemic Traces showing authentic reasoning development harder than actually having those conversations

  

---

  

### PDL-004: Good Faith Orientation Made Explicit

**What added:** Good faith orientation as third design principle (making implicit explicit)

  

**From Pattern Summary - Methodology Design:**

- "Design for willing participants, not hostile actors"

- "Self-selection: only transparent scholars submit"

- "Balance: verification + trust (not exhaustive auditing)"

  

**Why needed:**

- Section VII begins infrastructure specification

- Must establish philosophical foundation for VIII-IX

- Distinguishes from adversarial-design approaches

  

**Language implications:**

- "Enables" not "prevents"

- "Optimizes for" not "guards against"

- "Self-selection" not "gatekeeping"

  

---

  

### PDL-005: Radical Streamlining After Section VI Recognition

**Issue:** Initial guidance treated Section VII as needing to argue for discontinuity's value, but Section VI (complete, ~1,350 words) already did this comprehensively

  

**User observation:** Pointed to Section VI summary showing transformation mechanisms already established

  

**Redundancies eliminated:**

- Lengthy explanation why discontinuity needed (Section VI covered)

- Elaborate participant selection justification (Section VI covered)

- Repetitive transformation dynamics (Section VI did this)

- Over-explanation of strategic positioning (Section VI established)

  

**New focus:**

- SPECIFY what discontinuity means practically

- INTRODUCE three design principles

- REFERENCE Section VI, don't repeat

- IMPLEMENT strategic positioning through details

  

**Result:**

- Old: ~2,500 words with extensive justification

- New: ~1,500 words focused specification

- 40% reduction while preserving essential content

### PDL-006: Costly Signaling Dimension

**What added:** Costly signaling function to cost structure principle

  

**User prompt:** "Concerning the guidance, is the element of costly signaling mentioned? [...] mention the work of Hugo Mercier (not born yesterday) in relation to costly signaling and trust in communication"

  

**Enhancement:** Cost structure now serves dual purposes:

1. Makes fabrication more expensive than honesty (path of least resistance)

2. Serves as credible signal of quality/commitment (filtering and credentialing)

  

**Theoretical grounding:**

- Mercier (2020) "Not Born Yesterday": people assess communication trustworthiness through cost

- Costly signals harder to fake, more credible

- Transparency burden demonstrates genuine commitment

  

**Connection to Section VI:**

- "Raises bar rather than lowering it" (Section VI Part 2)

- High-quality AI work requires MORE effort than traditional OR casual prompting

- Opposite of "AI slop"

- Successful submission marks genuine achievement

  

**Significance:** Cost structure isn't just anti-gaming; it's positive credentialing mechanism inverting typical AI stigma

### PDL-007: Document Requirements Clarification

**Question:** Is Complete Prompt still needed for Section 7 writing, or has guidance compressed what's needed?

  

**Analysis:**

- Section 7 Guidance successfully extracted discontinuity specification from Complete Prompt

- Section VI summary more critical (shows what to reference, not repeat)

- Complete Prompt needed later (Sections VIII-IX have detailed specs there)

  

**Resolution:** For Section 7 specifically:

- **Essential:** SectionGuidance_Section7.md (sufficient alone)

- **Recommended:** Section VI summary (for accurate referencing)

- **Not needed:** Complete Prompt (save for Sections 8-9)

- **Not needed:** Pattern Summary Collection (key lessons already extracted)

  

**Rationale:** Guidance successfully compressed relevant concepts from all source materials

## Final Output: SectionGuidance_Section7.md

  

### Structure

  

**Context and Positioning**

- What Sections V-VI established

- Section VII's role: specify discontinuity, introduce design principles

- Not re-arguing, implementing

  

**Core Content**

- What discontinuity means practically (journal/track, no indexing, doesn't count for tenure)

- Three design principles:

  1. Ecological validity

  2. Good faith orientation

  3. Cost structure + costly signaling (Mercier 2020)

- Why discontinuity enables these principles

  

**Section Structure** (~1,000-1,200 words)

- Opening: Implementing strategic positioning (~150 words)

- Design Principles (~600 words, ~200 each)

- How discontinuity implements Section VI (~300 words)

- Transition to Sections VIII-IX (~100 words)

  

**Critical Writing Principles**

- Reference Section VI, don't repeat

- Constructive not defensive framing

- Three design principles as new contribution

- Appropriate length (trust reader retention)

- Flowing prose (no bullet points in body)

- Precise terminology

  

**Key Citations**

- Mercier (2020) for costly signaling

- Section VI for transformation dynamics

- Section V for motivated participants

- Section II for A+B insight

## Development Lessons

  

**Key insights from this process:**

  

1. **Framing is foundational:** Defensive vs. constructive framing changes entire approach

2. **Recognize what's already done:** Section VI completed transformation argument; Section VII implements

3. **Design principles as contribution:** Ecological validity, good faith, cost structure/costly signaling are Section VII's original content

4. **Streamline ruthlessly:** 40% reduction when recognized redundancy with Section VI

5. **Costly signaling crucial:** Not just making honesty easier, but creating credible quality signal

6. **Good faith orientation:** Design for willing participants, not adversaries

7. **Ecological validity:** Procedures must work in actual practice, not just theory

  

---

  

## Summary

  

**Fundamental transformation:** From defensive ("prevent gaming") to constructive ("implement Section VI's strategic positioning")

  

**Core additions:** Three design principles as Section VII's original contribution

1. Ecological validity (procedures that work in practice)

2. Good faith orientation (design for willing participants)

3. Cost structure + costly signaling (fabrication harder + credible quality signal with Mercier 2020)

  

**Key recognition:** Section VI already complete; Section VII should specify, not re-argue

  

**Result:** Streamlined guidance (~1,500 words) focused on practical specification

  

**Target output:** 1,000-1,200 words of philosophical prose specifying discontinuity and introducing design principles

  

**Status:** Section 7 Guidance complete and ready for drafting
