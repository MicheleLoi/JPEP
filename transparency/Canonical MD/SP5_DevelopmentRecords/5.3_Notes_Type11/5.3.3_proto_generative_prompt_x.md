# 5.3.3 Proto-Generative Prompt for Artifact “X” (for proto-SP2 generation), functionally equivalent to 5.4 (the generating prompt for SP2.1)

You are creating a purpose-built reproduction artifact called "X" for an 
academic philosophy paper (Sections 1-3 only: Introduction, Section 2: Incentives 
Analysis, Section 3: Why Contiguous Approaches Fail).

This paper was written with substantial AI assistance. X will be used by a 
reviewer to attempt reproducing these three sections using a current LLM.

SCOPE: This test covers ONLY the first three sections of a longer paper.

YOUR TASK:
Examine the provided materials and generate X as a single coherent document, 
approximately 6-8 pages, with EXACTLY six sections as specified below.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 1: ARGUMENT ARCHITECTURE (Target: ~1.5 pages)

Examine: Complete Prompt + Section Summaries

Your task:
1. Identify what Introduction, Section 2, and Section 3 each argue
2. Explain the CUMULATIVE LOGIC for sections 1-3:
   - How does Introduction frame the problem?
   - How does Section 2 (Incentives Analysis) build on Introduction?
   - How does Section 3 (Why Contiguous Approaches Fail) build on Section 2?
   - Why are these sections ordered this way?

3. Identify KEY STRUCTURAL DECISIONS:
   - Why develop incentives analysis before structural dilemma?
   - How does the paper's meta-status (testing its own hypothesis) function?
   - What dependencies exist between these sections?

4. Note CONTINUITY MECHANISMS:
   - How must Section 3 reference Section 2?
   - What must readers have internalized from each section?

FORMAT: Narrative explanation focused on cumulative logic across these three sections.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 2: AUTHOR GUIDANCE PATTERNS (Target: ~1.5 pages)

Examine: Epistemic Traces + MOD Trackers for sections 1-3

Your task:
Extract PATTERNS of author intervention across these three sections.

Categories to identify:

1. CONCEPTUAL REFRAMINGS
   - Major reconceptualizations author required
   - Fundamental corrections that shaped approach

2. REFINEMENT PRIORITIES  
   - What author emphasized repeatedly
   - Quality standards enforced
   - Problems flagged consistently

3. ATTRIBUTION/SOURCE HANDLING
   - How author corrected citations
   - Precision required in source usage

4. STRUCTURAL GUIDANCE
   - When author required reorganization
   - What triggered structural revisions

For each pattern:
- Identify from evidence in materials
- Give examples from sections 1-3
- Show how it manifests

FORMAT: Organized by guidance type with specific examples from these sections.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 3: REFINEMENT PATTERNS (Target: ~1.5 pages)

Examine: MOD Trackers for sections 1-3

Your task:
Extract refinement patterns that appeared across sections 1-3.

For each pattern:
- What problem does it address?
- How to identify when needed?
- How to correct it?
- Give example(s) from MOD trackers

Look for patterns like:
- Redundancy issues (especially cross-section between 2 and 3)
- Epistemic precision (conditional language for empirical claims)
- Style issues (training data artifacts)
- Attribution corrections
- Structural reorganizations

DO NOT list every MOD entry. Extract PATTERNS that recurred.

FORMAT: Pattern-based organization with problem→identification→correction→example.

Pay special attention to:
- MOD-19/20: Epistemic humility for Section 2
- MOD-21: Cross-section redundancy between Sections 2-3

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 4: SOURCE INTEGRATION STRATEGY (Target: ~1 page)

Examine: Complete Prompt reference sections

Your task:
Identify major sources cited in sections 1-3 and categorize by type.

Categories to identify:
- Philosophical sources (how deeply engaged?)
- Empirical/policy sources (what do they establish?)
- Classical sources (what role?)

For each major source used in sections 1-3:
- What does it provide for the argument?
- How deeply is it integrated?
- Primary vs secondary usage?

FORMAT: Source listing organized by type, showing integration approach.

Key sources to identify:
- Floridi (2025a,b)
- Daily Nous discussions  
- Journal policy sources (COPE, Elsevier, ACM, Science)
- Lund & Naheem (2023)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 5: SECTION DEVELOPMENT FLOW (Target: ~1.5 pages)

Examine: Section Summaries for sections 1-3

Your task:
Show how these three sections build sequentially.

FOR EACH SECTION (1, 2, 3):
1. Core argument (2-3 sentences)
2. How it builds on previous section(s)
3. What it sets up for next section
4. Key subsections
5. Word count if available
6. Critical moves specific to this section

Note continuity mechanisms:
- How Section 2 references Introduction
- How Section 3 references Section 2 (without re-deriving!)

FORMAT: Section-by-section showing cumulative building.

Pay attention to:
- Section 2: ~1,400 words with 4 subsections
- Section 3: ~950 words (reduced from 1,500 due to redundancy elimination)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 6: KEY INSIGHTS CHECKLIST (Target: ~1 page)

Examine: Complete Prompt + Section Summaries + your synthesis above

Your task:
List essential insights from sections 1-3 that MUST appear in reproduction.

Format as numbered list, one-sentence formulation each.

FROM INTRODUCTION:
- The paradox (transparency required but penalized)
- Four structural gaps identified
- Paper's meta-status

FROM SECTION 2:
- Three asymmetries creating incentive gradient
- "Just in case" reasoning
- Four underreporting mechanisms
- Transparency paradox

FROM SECTION 3:
- Contiguous venues inherit incentive problems
- Separation risks marginalization
- Structural dilemma

Aim for 12-15 key insights total from these three sections.

FORMAT: Numbered list, one sentence each, organized by section.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REQUIREMENTS:

1. TOTAL LENGTH: 6-8 pages
2. COHERENCE: Write as unified document
3. SYNTHESIS: Extract patterns, don't just list everything
4. PURPOSE: Enable reproduction of sections 1-3 specifically

Now examine the provided documents and generate X.
