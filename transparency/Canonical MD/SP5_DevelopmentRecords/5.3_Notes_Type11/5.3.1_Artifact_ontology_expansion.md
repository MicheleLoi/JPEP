# 5.3.1 Note: Artifact Ontology Expansion - Type 2b

5.3.1 Epistemic Trace: Artifact Ontology Expansion - Type 2b
Document Type: Type 11 - Notes Date: October 14, 2025 Topic: Addition of Type 2b (Section-Level Prompt Development Logs)


Problem Identified
While developing Section 7 Guidance (5.2.2), we encountered a categorization ambiguity:
Question: How should iterative refinement of Section Guidance be documented?
Initial approach: Labeled as "Type 1 - Epistemic Trace (Modification Log format)"
Problem: This conflated two distinct intellectual activities:
Idea exploration - where concepts first emerge through open-ended conversation
Instruction crystallization - where guidance is iteratively refined into actionable prompts

Analysis: Three Types of Pre-Writing Dialogues
Examining the actual practice revealed three distinct patterns:
Type A: Exploratory Epistemic Traces
Casual conversations where ideas first emerge
Unstructured brainstorming
Often with redactions for privacy
Example: "What if we frame discontinuity as strategic positioning?"
Type B: Methodological Epistemic Traces
Conversations generating reusable principles
Applied across multiple sections
Example: Good faith orientation discussion that applies to all infrastructure sections
Type C: Guidance Development Dialogues
Iterative refinement of specific section instructions
Structured improvement through feedback
Produces final Section Guidance artifact
Example: Section 7 Guidance refined through 6+ rounds of corrections
Key insight: Type C is fundamentally different from Types A and B

The Distinction
Epistemic Traces (Type 1):
Where ideas emerge
Exploratory and generative
Source material for developing concepts
"What should we think about this?"
Prompt Development Logs (Type 2):
Where instructions crystallize
Iterative refinement through feedback
Source material for creating actionable guidance
"How should we write about this?"

Parallel Structure Recognition
The paper already had Type 2 (Prompt Development Log) for project-level:
Complete Prompt evolution
How overall project instructions developed
PDL-001, PDL-002, etc. tracking iterations
Need identified: Same structure for section-level guidance development

Solution: Type 2 Expansion
Type 2a: Complete Prompt Development (Project-Level)
Evolution of overall project instructions
PromptDevelopmentLog.md
How Complete Prompt was refined
Type 2b: Section Guidance Development (Section-Level)
Evolution of specific section instructions
PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md
How each Section Guidance was refined
Parallel structure: Both document "instruction crystallization through dialogue"

Why This Matters
1. Ontological Clarity
Type 1: Ideas emerge
Type 2: Instructions crystallize
Different intellectual processes require different documentation
2. Functional Difference
Type 1 feeds forward into concept development
Type 2 feeds forward into execution (actual writing)
Different downstream uses
3. Transparency
Shows not just WHERE ideas came from (Type 1)
But also HOW writing instructions were refined (Type 2b)
Complete methodological disclosure
4. Reusability
Type 1: Conceptual insights for future work
Type 2b: Process patterns for developing other section guidance
Different lessons learned

Application to Section 7
What happened:
Initial guidance too defensive
Multiple rounds of refinement through user feedback
Added three design principles
Streamlined by 40% after recognizing Section VI complete
Added costly signaling dimension (Mercier)
Documentation:
This process = Type 2b (PromptDevelopmentLog_Section7.md)
Shows HOW Section 7 Guidance evolved from defensive to constructive framing
Tracks PDL-001 through PDL-007
Produces final SectionGuidance_Section7.md (Type 4)

Updated Artifact Structure
Pre-Writing Phase:
Type 1 (Epistemic Traces): Where ideas emerge
Type 2a (Complete Prompt Development): Project-level instruction crystallization
Type 2b (Section Guidance Development): Section-level instruction crystallization
Type 4 (Section Guidance): Final instructions (output of Type 2b)
Writing Phase:
Type 5 (Modification Logs): Changes during actual writing
Post-Writing Phase:
Type 9 (Reproduction Package): Processed for reproduction test

Rationale for Category Addition
Does this violate "no category proliferation" (Pattern Summary - Methodology Design)?
No, because:
Genuine functional need: Type 1 couldn't accurately describe instruction refinement process
Parallel to existing structure: Type 2 already existed; this is subdivision (2a/2b) not new category
Different intellectual process: Idea emergence ≠ instruction crystallization
Clear use case: Every section guidance goes through refinement; needs documentation
Transparency requirement: Paper argues for methodological disclosure; must document how instructions developed
This is specification, not proliferation.

Forward Application
For future sections (VIII, IX, X):
Each will have Section Guidance development
Each should have PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md (Type 2b)
Documents iterative refinement through dialogue
Shows how instructions crystallized
Pattern established:
Initial guidance attempt
User feedback
Iterative refinement (PDL-001, PDL-002, etc.)
Final SectionGuidance_SectionX.md

Summary
What changed: Type 2 subdivided into 2a (project) and 2b (section)
Why: Distinguish idea exploration (Type 1) from instruction crystallization (Type 2)
Impact: Clearer ontology, better transparency, accurate documentation of guidance development
Status: Type 2b established; first instance complete (PromptDevelopmentLog_Section7.md)
