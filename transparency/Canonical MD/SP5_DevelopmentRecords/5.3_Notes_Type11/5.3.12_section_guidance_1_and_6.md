# Section Guidance: Introduction (1) and Section 6

## Introduction (Section 1) Revision

### Objective
Moderate framing from prescriptive to experimental while preserving argumentative force. Acknowledge methodological reflexivity without undermining the approach.

### Specific Changes Needed
1. **Framing Shift**: Change from "this paper proposes" to "this paper explores" or "this paper tests"
2. **Methodological Acknowledgment**: Add 2-3 sentences acknowledging the bootstrapping paradox: "This paper faces a methodological paradox - it asks readers to evaluate a transparency framework through an example that presupposes the framework's value. However, this circularity serves an epistemic function..."
3. **Conditional Language**: When referencing policy implications, use "if such approaches prove viable..." rather than definitive statements
4. **Cost Signaling Emphasis**: Strengthen the argument that philosophy needs meaningful barriers between genuine intellectual work and sophisticated-sounding AI text generation

### Preserve
- Floridi engagement
- Gap identification in current debates
- Overall argumentative trajectory
- Intellectual ambition

## Section 6 Revision

### Objective
Moderate confidence levels for transformation mechanisms while preserving analytical framework.

### Specific Changes Needed
1. **Uncertainty Markers**: Add explicit qualifiers
   - "Four plausible dynamics might enable transformation..."
   - "If these mechanisms operate as predicted..."
   - "This represents one possible trajectory..."

2. **Language Moderation**: Replace certainty with possibility
   - "Will" → "might" or "could"
   - "Inevitable" → "plausible"
   - "Systematic" → "potential"

3. **Hypothesis Framing**: Present mechanisms as testable hypotheses requiring empirical validation rather than confident predictions

### Preserve
- Four mechanism framework (system degradation, feedback loops, external recognition, prestige inversion)
- Dynamic vs. static analysis distinction
- Strategic positioning argument
- Analytical rigor
