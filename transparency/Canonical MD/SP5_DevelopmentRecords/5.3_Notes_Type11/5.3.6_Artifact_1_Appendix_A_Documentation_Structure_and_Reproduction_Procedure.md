## Critical Context: The Radical Renumbering

All process artifacts (Modification Logs, Pattern Summaries, Section Guidance documents) use original section numbers from the writing process. The final paper underwent radical renumbering after consolidation:

**Writing Process (artifact numbering) → Final Paper:**
- Introduction (1) → Section 1 (unchanged)
- Incentives (2) + Contiguous (3) + Reviews (4) → Section 2 (consolidated)
- Why Engage (5) → Section 3
- Dilemma Reconsidered (6) → Section 4
- Discontinuity (7) → Section 5
- Mandatory Transparency (8) → Section 6
- Review Mechanism (9) → Section 7

Throughout this Appendix, both numbers appear where needed: "Section 5 (final Section 3)" helps readers navigate between process artifacts (old numbers) and final paper (new numbers).

Ecological Validity Note: The preservation of original numbering in artifacts demonstrates the paper's own principle—documentation reflects actual process, not a cleaned-up retrospective version.

## A.1 Overview of Reproduction Procedure

Reviewer B receives three core documents enabling reproduction assessment:

SP-1: Complete Prompt (~20 pages) – The synthesized instruction document containing full argument architecture, section specifications, tone requirements, and reference guidance. This served as the constant primary input throughout the writing process (sections 1-6 and 8 in original numbering).

SP-2: Reproduction Package (~15-20 pages) – A processed compilation generated from all process documentation (Types 1-8), organized into six sections: Architectural Overview, Guidance Patterns Across Sections, Refinement Patterns, Source Integration Approach, Development Flow, and Key Insights Checklist. This synthesizes patterns and insights from the complete process record.

SP-3: Reproduction Guide (~5 pages) – Instructions explaining how to combine SP-1 and SP-2 for reproduction, what comparison criteria to use, and what constitutes a passing threshold.

The basic workflow begins with SP-3 to understand the procedure, then loads SP-1 (Complete Prompt) as primary input to the LLM. Reviewer B uses SP-2 for section-by-section guidance, noting key insights and refinement patterns, then generates comparable work following the procedure. Finally, the reviewer compares reproduction to submitted paper using trajectory-matching criteria.

Time estimates for basic reproduction suggest 2-3 hours reviewing materials, 2-4 hours conducting reproduction, and 1-2 hours for comparison and assessment, totaling approximately 5-9 hours. Additional time may be warranted if reproduction results suggest deeper investigation of process documentation (SP-4) or development records (SP-5).

SP-3 (Reproduction Guide) provides instructions for combining SP-1 and SP-2 effectively, explains comparison criteria (trajectory matching rather than output matching), and specifies the pass threshold: documented inputs must be sufficient to generate work of this character, with gaps attributable to expected editorial refinement rather than missing documentation.

## A.2 Document Creation Flow and Relationships

[Figure 1: Document Creation Flow - See Figure 1 for visual representation of the complete document creation process across six phases]

Figure 1 presents the paper's development as a network of document types, creation sequences, and information flows. The visualization shows six distinct phases, from pre-writing through final appendix creation, with varying input configurations and accumulation patterns that reflect the actual development process.

### Phase Structure Overview

The graph's left-to-right progression traces chronological development while revealing asynchronous work patterns. Phase 1 (Pre-Writing) establishes foundational documents. Phase 2 (Main Writing, Sections 1-6 old numbering) shows repeating patterns with forward accumulation. Phase 3 (Methodology Design Branch) splits from the main timeline for parallel conceptual work. Phase 4 (Later Writing, Sections 7-9) demonstrates varying input configurations including temporary absence of core materials. Phase 5 (Post-Draft Editorial Revision) shows parallel revision tracks converging in a consolidation event. Phase 6 (Appendix) receives inputs from all previous phases as convergence point.

### Key Structural Features

**Epistemic Traces' Dual Purpose:** As shown in Phase 1, these foundational documents serve both as source material for Complete Prompt development and as constant voice calibration input throughout writing—a one-to-many influence pattern distinguishing them from other document types.

**Forward Accumulation:** The stacked visual effects in Phase 2 illustrate how Pattern Summaries, Section Summaries, and Reference Logs accumulated across sections, with each new section receiving all previously generated materials plus creating new contributions for subsequent sections.

**Complete Prompt Variability:** The thick arrow from Phase 1 through Phase 2 shows Complete Prompt as constant input for sections 1-6 and 8, but notably absent for Section 7—a significant deviation visible in the input configuration changes across Phase 4.

**Section 7→8 Transition Complexity:** The curved feedback arrows between these sections (Phase 4) illustrate an unusual development pattern: content initially generated for Section 7's ending was deemed inadequate, repositioned to Section 8's beginning through iterative feedback, and refined through multiple attempts before achieving satisfactory form. This complexity contrasts with the more straightforward section transitions visible in Phase 2.

**The Consolidation Event:** Phase 5's convergence visualization shows three separate sections (2, 3, 4 in old numbering) merging into a single section (new Section 2), with three distinct Modification Logs preserved alongside a new consolidation log. The cascading renumbering effect ripples through all subsequent sections, creating the mismatch between artifact numbering and final paper numbering discussed throughout this Appendix.

**Methodology Design Asynchrony:** The branching track in Phase 3 represents qualitatively different work—conceptual infrastructure development for Sections 8, 9, and Appendix conducted while earlier sections were still being written. This parallel work generated guidance documents and naming conventions that fed back into the main timeline before Section 7 began.

### Ecological Validity Demonstration

The graph's complexity demonstrates rather than merely describes the ecological validity principle this paper advocates. The branching paths represent genuine asynchrony in intellectual work. The feedback loops capture actual revision processes including initial failures. The varying input configurations across sections reflect adaptive methodology rather than predetermined process. The consolidation event and resulting renumbering mismatch preserve what actually happened rather than presenting a sanitized linear narrative.

Real creative scholarly work involves false starts (Section 7→8 transition), repositioned content (three-section consolidation), parallel conceptual development (methodology design branch), and iterative refinement requiring multiple attempts (13 modifications for Section 5, final Section 3). The graph preserves this messiness as valuable documentation rather than documentation failure. Transparent documentation means showing the actual architecture of intellectual development, including parts that don't fit neatly into predetermined categories.

## A.3 The Eleven Document Types

This section defines all document types produced during the writing process, organized by phase of creation.

### Writing Phase Types (Foundation & Execution)

**Type 1: Complete Prompt**

Created before writing begins (result of prompt development process documented in Type 8). Serves as foundational instruction document providing synthesized specifications for generating the paper.

Contains approximately 20 pages covering: central problem framing (the "laundering" barrier preventing direct publication of AI-assisted work), incentive gradient analysis (why prestige work faces maximum underreporting pressure), solution architecture (discontinuity from prestige system plus mandatory transparency), dual-reviewer reproduction mechanism (sufficiency testing and authorship anchoring), tone requirements (dry philosophical prose), reference lists with relevance assessments, and structural specifications for all eleven sections from Preliminary Note through Conclusion.

Played constant primary role in forward writing throughout sections 1-6 and 8 (old numbering). Temporarily absent for Section 7 (final Section 5), where writing relied on Section Guidance and accumulated summaries instead. Essential for documentation—shows what instructions guided the work throughout most of the process.

File: CompletePrompt.md

---

**Type 2: Epistemic Trace**

Created asynchronously to linear section-writing process. Defining characteristic: one-to-many influence. These are foundational documents that influence multiple downstream outputs, not tied to single section execution. They represent exploratory or preparatory work happening outside the main sequence.

Serve as foundational documents with broad influence across multiple sections or aspects of the work. Three related functions emerge: source material for frameworks, concepts, and structures used across multiple sections; voice and style preservation used throughout writing (constant input alongside Complete Prompt); strategic or conceptual work informing multiple later decisions.

Appear as verbatim or near-verbatim excerpts (with redactions for privacy) from exploratory conversations, presented in Phase-based narrative format showing back-and-forth dialogue. Can include: methodology design dialogues, editorial consultations, architectural planning. Characterized by asynchrony—working ahead conceptually or stepping outside the linear flow to reconsider foundations.

Examples in this paper include: Primary Epistemic Trace showing early conceptual explorations about the journal idea, which informed Complete Prompt development and voice calibration across all sections; Methodology Design preliminary chats where infrastructure for Sections 8/9/Appendix was explored while writing earlier sections (MOD-M01 through MOD-M37 documented in process logs); Values framework dialogue establishing Level 1 vs Level 2 distinction (doing philosophy with AI vs studying AI) applied across documentation; Editorial Audit where one consultation led to multiple section revisions for tone consistency.

Role in forward writing varies depending on the trace. Some remained constant (voice calibration throughout), others influenced specific later sections (methodology design affecting Sections 8-9). Essential for documentation—shows foundational thinking that shaped multiple outputs and understanding why certain approaches were taken.

Key distinction from other types: Section Guidance (Type 3) involves one-to-one relationship (specific section); Pattern Summary (Type 4) builds accumulative/sequential from completed work; Epistemic Trace (Type 2) provides one-to-many foundational influence across multiple outputs.

File pattern: EpistemicTrace_TopicDescriptor.md or PreliminaryChat_SectionX_ChatY.md (when exploratory dialogue occurred before or during section development)

---

**Type 3: Section Guidance**

Created before writing each section, through two possible mechanisms: preliminary chat or dialogue session conducted before writing begins, or request created at end of previous section's completion before moving to new chat.

Provides section-specific instructions for writing, tailored to that section's particular requirements. Contains structural deviations from Complete Prompt (when section needs different approach), continuity requirements (what to reference from previous sections versus what to repeat), planned connections to previous sections' arguments, methodological guidance specific to that section's challenges, target word count, and tone specifications.

Served as direct input to that section's writing process. Each section had specific guidance beyond the Complete Prompt's general specifications. Essential for documentation—shows how sections connected and how writing adapted to emerging needs across the paper's development.

File pattern: SectionGuidance_SectionX.md

---

**Type 4: Pattern Summary**

Created after section complete, extracted from Modification Log (Type 7). Purpose: generalizable lessons useful for forward tasks in subsequent sections.

Not all modifications become patterns—only those with broader applicability beyond the specific section warrant extraction. Examples include "Attribution precision patterns" (how to cite sources appropriately), "Redundancy elimination approaches" (recognizing and removing LLM-typical repetition), "Epistemic humility for a priori claims" (when to use conditional language). These provide reusable guidance for similar work in later sections.

Served as input to next sections as accumulating resource. Pattern Summaries from all previous sections were provided when writing each new section, creating forward-building methodological refinement. Essential for documentation—shows methodological learning across the process and what was discovered about effective AI-assisted writing through iterative practice.

File pattern: PatternSummary_SectionX.md

---

**Type 5: Section Summary**

Created after section complete. Captures what this section says—its argument, key moves, and structure.

Used to maintain coherence across sections, ensuring later sections could reference earlier arguments accurately and avoid redundant restatement. Typically included: main thesis, argumentative structure, key concepts introduced, connections to other sections.

Served as input to next sections for continuity. Each section's writer needed to understand what previous sections had established. Essential for documentation—shows argument flow across the complete paper and understanding how the paper's thesis developed sequentially.

File pattern: SectionSummary_SectionX.md

---

**Type 6: Reference Log**

Created after section complete, only if that section adds citations. Tracks citations added in this section and their function.

Contains how each source is used, relation to sources cited in previous sections (to avoid redundant citations or contradictory uses), assessment of source quality and relevance. Note: Only created for sections that added literature—not all sections required new citations.

Served as input to next sections to avoid redundancy and build on previous source engagement coherently. Essential for documentation—shows depth of source engagement and scholarly rigor in citation practices.

File pattern: ReferenceLog_SectionX.md

---

**Type 7: Modification Log**

Created during section writing, documenting iterative refinement in real-time or shortly after. Tracks what changed and why throughout the section's development.

Not verbatim conversation logs. These are rewritten (with some condensing) documentation of changes that occurred during dialogue. Captures the full spectrum: simple citation format corrections to major conceptual restructuring to user corrections including direct feedback like "cut this, I hate it." Shows reasoning behind changes and sometimes records multiple rounds of refinement (Section 5, final Section 3, underwent 13 documented modifications).

Numbering restarts at MOD-001 for each section, making each log self-contained.

Purely retrospective record of what happened during writing—not used as input to subsequent sections (though Pattern Summaries extracted from these logs were used forward). Essential for documentation—shows author's reasoning about changes, collaborative nature of AI-assisted writing, and honest acknowledgment of what required correction or improvement.

File pattern: ModificationLog_SectionX.md

---

### Pre-Writing Phase Type

**Type 8: Prompt Development Log**

Created before or between sections when guidance documents are being developed. Documents evolution of instructions—not the ideas themselves, but how exploration became actionable instructions.

Structured documentation shows how exploratory work became actionable guidance. Uses PDL-XXX numbering format (PDL-001, PDL-002, etc.). Each entry shows: Issue identified, Changes made, Rationale, Impact.

The critical distinction: Preliminary chats where exploration occurs appear as Type 2 (Epistemic Traces)—verbatim or near-verbatim exploratory dialogue in Phase-based narrative format. Structured logs documenting how that exploration became guidance appear as Type 8 (Prompt Development Logs)—decision tracking with PDL-XXX numbering.

Key rule: If the document is structured as PDL-XXX or similar, tracking decisions that culminate in creating a prompt or guidance document, it's Type 8. If it's exploratory dialogue showing back-and-forth reasoning, it's Type 2.

Two contexts emerge:

Type 8a: Complete Prompt Development (project-level). File: PromptDevelopmentLog.md. Shows how Epistemic Traces (Type 2) were converted into Complete Prompt (Type 1) through iterative refinement. Documents decisions about argument structure, inclusion/exclusion of topics, tone requirements.

Type 8b: Section Guidance Development (section-level). File pattern: PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md. Structured documentation showing how Epistemic Traces (Type 2 preliminary chats) plus feedback loops became section-specific instructions. Example: PromptDevelopmentLog_Section7.md contains PDL-001 through PDL-007 tracking defensive→constructive reframing decisions. Each PDL entry shows: Issue identified (problem with draft guidance), Changes made (specific revisions), Rationale (why this improves guidance), Impact (what this enables in final section).

The Complete Prompt or Section Guidance itself (outputs of this process) were used in forward writing, not these development logs. Essential for documentation—provides transparency about instruction development and shows how scattered exploratory thinking (Type 2) was crystallized into actionable specifications (Type 1 or Type 3).

Relationship: Type 2 (Epistemic Traces) feeds into Type 8 (Prompt Development Logs), which produces Type 1 (Complete Prompt) or Type 3 (Section Guidance).

File pattern: PromptDevelopmentLog.md or PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md

---

### Post-Writing Phase Types

**Type 9: Reproduction Package**

Created after all sections complete. Processed compilation enabling reproduction by Reviewer B.

Generated via preprocessing prompt applied to SP-4 (all Type 1-8 materials). Not raw materials but synthesized, curated overview. Structure consists of six sections: Architectural Overview (how argument components relate), Guidance Patterns Across Sections (recurring instructions and approaches), Refinement Patterns (what editorial improvements to expect), Source Integration Approach (how citations and literature were handled), Development Flow (how ideas emerged and evolved), Key Insights Checklist (essential points that should appear in reproduction).

Created after writing complete, for reviewer use. Essential for documentation—enables reproduction test by providing processed, usable compilation of process patterns rather than overwhelming reviewer with raw materials.

File: Becomes SP-2 in supplementary materials

---

**Type 10: Reproduction Guide**

Created after all sections complete. Instructions for Reviewer B conducting reproduction assessment.

Explains how to combine SP-1 (Complete Prompt) and SP-2 (Reproduction Package), comparison criteria (trajectory matching rather than output matching), pass threshold specification (documented inputs sufficient to generate work of this character, with gap attributable to expected refinement), time estimates, and guidance on when to consult full process documentation (SP-4).

Created after writing complete, for reviewer use. Essential for documentation—enables reviewer to use materials effectively without requiring extensive training in the documentation system.

File: Becomes SP-3 in supplementary materials

---

### Utility Type

**Type 11: Notes**

Created throughout process as needed. Working documents, organization notes, reference verification records, file structure decisions.

Not methodologically relevant to understanding the writing process itself. Includes: citation accuracy checks, renaming/relabeling documentation, organizational decisions about file structure. Supports integrity and organization but doesn't illuminate the intellectual development of the paper.

Not used in forward writing. Not included in final supplementary materials (SP-1 through SP-5) submitted for review.

File pattern: Various working notes, not systematically named

## A.4 This Paper's Supplementary Materials

### Section Numbering Reference Table

To navigate between supplementary materials (which use writing-process numbering) and the final paper:

| Process Artifacts (old numbering) | Final Paper Section (new numbering) |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Section 1 | Section 1: Introduction |
| Sections 2+3+4 | Section 2: Systemic Barriers (consolidated) |
| Section 5 | Section 3: Why Engage |
| Section 6 | Section 4: Dilemma Reconsidered |
| Section 7 | Section 5: Discontinuity |
| Section 8 | Section 6: Mandatory Transparency |
| Section 9 | Section 7: Review Mechanism |

All process documentation uses original section numbers. This preservation demonstrates the ecological validity principle—documentation reflects actual process rather than cleaned-up retrospective version. When examining supplementary materials, readers should refer to this table to connect process artifacts (using old section numbers) with corresponding final paper sections (using new numbers).

---

### The Five Supplementary Files

**SP-1: Complete Prompt (Type 1)**

Approximately 20 pages containing final synthesized prompt from the prompt development process (documented in SP-5 Part 1). Content includes: complete paper structure specification (eleven sections from Preliminary Note through Conclusion), central problem framing (the "laundering" barrier requiring substantial rewriting for AI-assisted work to enter formal venues), incentive gradient analysis (why prestige papers face maximum underreporting pressure), dual solution architecture (discontinuity from prestige system plus mandatory full methodological transparency), dual-reviewer mechanism specification (split review with reproduction test serving sufficiency and authorship anchoring purposes), tone requirements (dry philosophical prose, rigorous argumentation, acknowledge uncertainty), reference lists with relevance assessments for pragmatist and philosophy of technology sources.

Used as constant input throughout sections 1-6 and 8 (old numbering). Temporarily absent for Section 7 (final Section 5), returning for Section 8 (final Section 6). Reviewer B loads this as primary input when conducting reproduction.

---

**SP-2: Reproduction Package (Type 9)**

Approximately 15-20 pages generated from SP-4 via preprocessing prompt that synthesizes all Type 1-8 materials into accessible overview. Six-section structure includes:

Architectural Overview shows how the paper's argumentative components relate, the two-part solution structure (discontinuity plus transparency), and connection between problem analysis (Sections 2-4, old numbering) and solution specification (Sections 6-8, old numbering).

Guidance Patterns Across Sections presents recurring instructions visible across section guidance documents: reference-don't-repeat principle, epistemic humility requirements for empirical claims, anti-redundancy discipline, appropriate abstraction levels for different sections.

Refinement Patterns describes what editorial improvements to expect: redundancy elimination (particularly LLM-typical repetition), attribution precision, tone consistency, defensive framing removal. Extracted from Pattern Summaries (Type 4) across all sections.

Source Integration Approach explains how philosophical literature was engaged: pragmatist sources (Dewey, Quine, Mill) for a posteriori emphasis, philosophy of technology sources (Byrne, Wheeler, Floridi) for creativity and tool-mediated discovery, attribution precision distinguishing primary sources from philosophical analysis of those sources.

Development Flow traces how ideas emerged and evolved: early incentive analysis leading to recognition of prestige gradient, wonder-driven motivation requiring dynamic transformation analysis (Section 6, final Section 4), methodology design branch creating infrastructure for later sections (8-9 and Appendix).

Key Insights Checklist identifies essential points that should appear in reproduction: the "laundering" barrier, incentive gradient creating perverse underreporting, contiguous approaches inheriting incentive problems, discontinuity as cultural filter not procedural necessity, reproduction test dual purposes, ecological validity principle.

Synthesizes patterns from complete process record, providing Reviewer B with curated, usable guidance rather than overwhelming with raw process documentation.

---

**SP-3: Reproduction Guide (Type 10)**

Approximately 5 pages of instructions for Reviewer B explaining procedure, comparison criteria, and pass threshold. Covers how to combine SP-1 (load as primary input) with SP-2 (use for section-specific guidance and insight checklist), what "reproduction" means (trajectory matching not output matching), pass threshold specification (documented inputs sufficient to generate work of this character, gaps attributable to expected refinement not missing documentation), time estimates (5-9 hours for basic reproduction), when to consult deeper documentation (SP-4 for process details, SP-5 for instruction development).

Comparison criteria include: intellectual architecture match (does reproduction follow same argumentative trajectory?), key insights presence (are essential points from checklist represented?), argument structure reproducibility (are major moves and connections present?), gap analysis (are differences explainable by editorial refinement or do they suggest undocumented intellectual work?).

---

**SP-4: Process Documentation (approximately 35-55 pages consolidated)**

All Type 1-7 materials organized into seven parts:

Part 1: Complete Prompt (Type 1). CompletePrompt.md—same content as SP-1, included here for completeness of process documentation. Maintains SP-4 as comprehensive, self-contained process record while SP-1 provides standalone access for Reviewer B.

Part 2: Modification Logs (Type 7). Includes ModificationLog_Section1.md (Introduction - unchanged in renumbering), ModificationLog_Section2.md (Incentives - now part of consolidated final Section 2), ModificationLog_Section3.md (Contiguous Approaches - now part of consolidated final Section 2), ModificationLog_Section4.md (Unfair Reviews - now part of consolidated final Section 2), ModificationLog_Section2_Consolidation.md (documents the three-section merger), ModificationLog_Section5.md (Why Engage - final Section 3; contains 13 modification entries showing extensive iterative refinement), ModificationLog_Section6.md (Dilemma Reconsidered - final Section 4), ModificationLog_Section7.md (Discontinuity - final Section 5), ModificationLog_Section8.md (Mandatory Transparency - final Section 6; includes preliminary chat from Section 7→8 transition), ModificationLog_Section9.md (Review Mechanism - final Section 7). Documentation only—not used in forward writing but essential for showing detailed development process, including user corrections and iterative improvements.

Part 3: Pattern Summaries (Type 4). PatternSummary_Section1.md through PatternSummary_Section9.md (using old numbering). Used in forward writing as accumulating resource and documentation of methodological learning. Extracted from Modification Logs with specific intention: identify generalizable lessons with broader applicability to subsequent sections.

Part 4: Section Guidance (Type 3). SectionGuidance_Section1.md through SectionGuidance_Section9.md (old numbering), plus SectionGuidance_Appendix.md. Created either via preliminary chat sessions or as requests at end of previous section before moving to new chat. Used in forward writing and documentation of how sections were designed to connect.

Part 5: Section Summaries (Type 5). SectionSummary_Section1.md through SectionSummary_Section9.md (old numbering). Used in forward writing to maintain continuity and documentation of argument flow.

Part 6: Reference Logs (Type 6). Only sections with citations (not all sections required new literature). Used in forward writing to avoid redundancy and documentation of source engagement depth.

Part 7: All Epistemic Traces (Type 2). Definition note: Epistemic Traces are foundational documents characterized by one-to-many influence. They're created asynchronously to linear section writing and shape multiple downstream outputs. Format: verbatim or near-verbatim exploratory dialogue, often in Phase-based narrative structure.

Files included: Primary Epistemic Trace (EpistemicTrace_OriginalTextExtractForFinalSynthesis.md) showing early conceptual explorations about the journal idea, influenced both Complete Prompt development and voice calibration across all sections. Methodology Design through PreliminaryChat sessions documenting artifact ontology development (MOD-M01 through MOD-M37 in process logs)—how review mechanism and documentation structure were developed, became basis for Sections 8, 9, and Appendix infrastructure. Section 7-8 Development through PreliminaryChat_Section7_Chat2.md and PreliminaryChat_Section8_Chat2.md—values analysis (epistemic, pedagogical, traditional scholarly values), Level 1 vs Level 2 distinction (doing philosophy with AI vs studying AI), repositioning decisions and philosophical grounding for transparency requirements. Any other epistemic traces created asynchronously to linear writing process.

---

**SP-5: Development Records (approximately 10-15 pages)**

Contains only Type 8 (Prompt Development Logs) plus Type 11 (Notes)—the meta-level documentation of how instructions evolved.

Part 1: Prompt Development Log - Complete Prompt (Type 8a). PromptDevelopmentLog.md showing PDL-001 through final version (approximately 17 entries). Shows how Epistemic Traces (now in SP-4 Part 7) were converted into Complete Prompt (Type 1) through iterative refinement. Structured decision tracking with PDL-XXX format: Issue identified, Changes made, Rationale, Impact. Documents major decisions including coherence fixes (disclosure timing inconsistency), structural revisions (meta-argument repositioning), goal specifications (producing knowledge not rewarding merit), discontinuity justification strengthening.

Part 2: Prompt Development Logs - Section Guidance (Type 8b). PromptDevelopmentLog_Section7.md (PDL-001 through PDL-007: tracking defensive→constructive reframing transformation), PromptDevelopmentLog_SectionX.md (if applicable for other sections requiring structured guidance development). Shows how Epistemic Traces (Type 2 preliminary chats in SP-4 Part 7) became Section Guidance (Type 3) through documented refinement process. Structured logs with PDL-XXX format, not the exploratory dialogue itself (that's Type 2).

Part 3: Reference Verification Notes (Type 11). Citations checked for accuracy (Floridi 2025 papers, Dewey edition verification, etc.). Not methodologically central but supports scholarly integrity.

Part 4: Organizational Documentation (Type 11). Renaming and relabeling documentation (artifact naming conventions established during methodology design), file structure decisions, other working notes supporting organization.

---

### Total Volume and Organizational Logic

Approximately 80-110 pages across five files. For basic reproduction, Reviewer B needs approximately 25-45 pages (SP-1, SP-2, SP-3). Full transparency materials available in SP-4 and SP-5 for deeper investigation if reproduction unclear or if reviewer wants to examine process in detail.

SP-4 contains everything from the writing process: what guided the work (Complete Prompt, Section Guidance), what changed during writing (Modification Logs), what was learned (Pattern Summaries), what provided continuity (Section Summaries, Reference Logs), what sourced the thinking (Epistemic Traces).

SP-5 documents how guidance evolved: meta-level showing how exploratory source material (Type 2) became actionable instructions (Type 1 and Type 3) through structured refinement (Type 8), plus technical notes supporting integrity (Type 11).

This separation maintains clarity: SP-4 shows the writing process itself; SP-5 shows how instructions for that process were developed.

---

## A.5 Guide to Using Supplementary Materials

### For Reviewer B (Reproduction Task)

Begin with SP-3 (Reproduction Guide) to understand the workflow, comparison criteria (trajectory matching not output matching), pass threshold (sufficiency with expected refinement gap), and section numbering mismatch (see mapping table in A.4 above).

Load SP-1 (Complete Prompt) as primary input—the main instruction set (~20 pages) containing argument architecture (problem analysis plus dual-component solution), section specifications, tone requirements (dry philosophical prose), and reference guidance. This served as constant input throughout original writing (sections 1-6 and 8 in old numbering).

Use SP-2 (Reproduction Package) for section-by-section guidance. Architectural Overview explains how components relate. Guidance Patterns note recurring principles like reference-don't-repeat and epistemic humility. Refinement Patterns indicate what editorial improvements to expect (redundancy elimination, attribution precision). Source Integration shows how philosophical literature was engaged. Development Flow traces how ideas emerged sequentially. Key Insights Checklist lists essential points that should appear in reproduction.

Generate comparable work following the procedure specified in SP-3. Use SP-1 as base instructions (load as primary input to LLM). Reference SP-2 for each section's specific guidance and expected insights. Expected time: 2-4 hours for generation process.

Compare and assess whether reproduction matches intellectual architecture (does it follow same argumentative trajectory?), whether key insights are present (are essential points from SP-2 checklist represented?), whether argument structure proves reproducible (are major moves and connections present?), and whether gaps are attributable to expected refinement (differences explainable by editorial polish versus suggesting undocumented intellectual work).

If needed, consult SP-4 (Process Documentation) for deeper investigation when reproduction results prove unclear. Modification Logs show detailed section development with user corrections. Pattern Summaries show what was learned across sections. Epistemic Traces show foundational thinking that shaped multiple sections. Remember: artifacts use old section numbering—refer to mapping table in A.4 when connecting to final paper.

---

### For Editorial Assessment

SP-1 (Complete Prompt) shows documented inputs—what author claimed to use as foundational instructions. Enables assessing whether disclosure is comprehensive.

SP-2 (Reproduction Package) provides processed overview of patterns and insights. Useful for understanding scope and depth of process without examining raw materials.

SP-3 (Reproduction Guide) explains procedure for verification. Shows author has provided clear path for reproduction assessment.

SP-4 (Process Documentation) demonstrates transparency depth—full process visible including iterative refinement, user corrections, methodological learning. Shows author committed to maximum rather than minimal disclosure.

SP-5 (Development Records) shows instruction development—how guidance evolved from exploratory thinking into actionable specifications. Demonstrates systematic refinement of methodology.

---

### For Methodological Researchers

SP-4 Part 7 (Epistemic Traces) shows intellectual origins and foundational conversations that shaped multiple aspects of the work. Particularly valuable for understanding how asynchronous exploration (like methodology design branch) influenced later sections.

SP-4 Part 2 (Modification Logs) documents iterative refinement with honest acknowledgment of what required correction. Section 5 (final Section 3) shows 13 modifications; consolidation log documents three-section merger. Evidence of genuine collaborative process including user corrections like "cut this, I hate it."

SP-4 Part 3 (Pattern Summaries) shows methodological learning across the writing process. Examples include epistemic humility patterns for a priori claims, redundancy elimination approaches addressing LLM-typical repetition, attribution precision distinguishing primary sources from philosophical analysis.

SP-5 Part 1 (Prompt Development Log for Complete Prompt) shows Complete Prompt evolution through approximately 17 PDL entries. Demonstrates how scattered thinking consolidated into coherent instructions.

SP-5 Part 2 (Section-level Prompt Development Logs) shows section guidance refinement. Example: Section 7 guidance evolved through 7 PDL entries tracking defensive→constructive reframing transformation.

---

### Note on Numbering

All documentation uses original section numbers from the writing process. When examining process artifacts and connecting to final paper sections, refer to the mapping table at the beginning of A.4 above. This preservation of original numbering demonstrates ecological validity—showing actual process rather than cleaned-up version. The mismatch between artifact numbering and final paper numbering is not a documentation error but a principled decision to preserve what really happened, including the three-section consolidation event that caused radical renumbering.
