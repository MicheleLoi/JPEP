# 5.3.5 First (proto) Reviewer Prompt for using the first (proto) Reproduction Prompt

You are a reviewer attempting to reproduce sections 1-3 of an academic 
philosophy paper using the author's documented inputs.

You have been provided:
1. Complete Prompt - base instructions for the paper
2. X artifact - compressed guidance showing how the paper was developed

YOUR TASK:
Generate sections 1-3 of the paper (Introduction, Section 2: Incentives Analysis, 
Section 3: Why Contiguous Approaches Fail) following the Complete Prompt and 
incorporating guidance from X.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 1: REVIEW PREPARATION (Do this mentally, don't output)

1. Read Complete Prompt fully
   - Understand the paper's goal
   - Note the argument structure for sections 1-3
   - Identify tone and style requirements
   - Review reference lists

2. Read X artifact fully
   - Section 1: Understand the cumulative architecture
   - Section 2: Note author guidance patterns
   - Section 3: Internalize refinement patterns to apply
   - Section 4: Note source integration approach
   - Section 5: Understand how sections build on each other
   - Section 6: Keep insights checklist for self-checking

3. Plan your approach
   - Generate sections sequentially (Intro → 2 → 3)
   - After each section, apply refinement patterns from X
   - Maintain continuity as described in X

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 2: GENERATE INTRODUCTION

Using Complete Prompt specifications for Introduction:
- Open with Floridi's "distant writing" concept
- Frame current debates (Daily Nous, teaching vs research)
- Establish policy landscape (journal policies, mandatory disclosure)
- Present the paradox (transparency required but penalized)
- Identify four structural gaps
- Declare paper's meta-status
- Provide roadmap of sections

Apply guidance from X:
- Follow structural decisions noted in X Section 1
- Integrate sources per strategy in X Section 4
- Use tone/style from Complete Prompt

Length target: ~1,400 words based on X Section 5

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 3: GENERATE SECTION 2 - INCENTIVES ANALYSIS

Using Complete Prompt specifications for Section 2:
- Establish three asymmetries (disclosure permanent, significance uncertain, 
  costs front-loaded)
- Develop incentive gradient
- Explain underreporting mechanisms
- Present transparency paradox
- Draw implications for venue design

Subsections (from X Section 5):
- 2.1 The Incentive Gradient
- 2.2 The Underreporting Mechanism  
- 2.3 The Transparency Paradox
- 2.4 Implications for Venue Design

Apply refinement patterns from X Section 3:
- Use conditional language for empirical claims (mechanisms "could operate" 
  not "operate")
- Frame mechanisms as plausible hypotheses requiring empirical validation
- Avoid "demonstrates" - use "analyzes how"
- Write in flowing prose (no bullet points)

Apply guidance from X Section 2:
- Follow any conceptual framings author emphasized
- Apply refinement priorities noted

Length target: ~1,400 words based on X Section 5

Critical requirement from X: This section ESTABLISHES the analysis that 
Section 3 will reference. Make the three asymmetries and "just in case" 
reasoning clear and memorable.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 4: GENERATE SECTION 3 - WHY CONTIGUOUS APPROACHES FAIL

Using Complete Prompt specifications for Section 3:
- Show why venues maintaining continuity with prestige structures fail
- Show why venues achieving complete separation fail  
- Present structural dilemma
- Suggest resolution may be possible

Subsections (from X Section 5):
- 3.1 The Contiguous Approach and Its Failure
- 3.2 The Separation Alternative and Its Failure
- 3.3 The Dilemma's Structure
- 3.4 Toward Resolution

CRITICAL guidance from X Sections 2-3:
- REFERENCE Section 2's analysis, DO NOT re-derive it
- Assume reader has internalized the three asymmetries
- Do not re-explain "just in case" reasoning
- Do not re-walk through the incentive mechanisms
- Trust the reader; show how previous analysis APPLIES to new case

Apply refinement patterns from X Section 3:
- Eliminate cross-section redundancy ruthlessly
- No internal restatements within section
- Cut meta-commentary ("This section will...")
- Flowing prose, no bullet points

Length target: ~950 words based on X Section 5
(Note: X indicates this was reduced from 1,500 due to redundancy elimination)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 5: SELF-CHECK AGAINST X SECTION 6 CHECKLIST

After generating all three sections, verify these key insights appear:

FROM INTRODUCTION:
□ Paradox: transparency required but penalized
□ Four structural gaps identified
□ Paper's meta-status declared

FROM SECTION 2:
□ Three asymmetries creating gradient
□ "Just in case" reasoning
□ Four underreporting mechanisms (conditional language)
□ Transparency paradox
□ Contiguous venues inherit problems (sets up Section 3)

FROM SECTION 3:
□ Contiguous venues inherit incentive structure
□ Separation risks marginalization
□ Structural dilemma presented
□ Both horns rest on assumptions worth examining

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. Generate complete text for:
   - Introduction (with section heading)
   - Section 2: Incentives Analysis (with heading and subsection headings)
   - Section 3: Why Contiguous Approaches Fail (with heading and subsection headings)

2. Use dry, philosophical prose throughout (per Complete Prompt)

3. Include citations in (Author Year) format where appropriate

4. Maintain continuity:
   - Section 2 opening should reference Introduction's paradox
   - Section 3 opening should reference Section 2's conclusion
   - Section 3 should reference (not re-explain) Section 2's mechanisms

5. Total output: approximately 3,300-3,800 words for all three sections combined

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BEGIN GENERATION NOW.

Generate sections sequentially: Introduction, then Section 2, then Section 3.
