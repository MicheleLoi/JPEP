## A.4 This Article's Supplementary Materials

All supplementary materials are available at: `https://github.com/MicheleLoi/JPEP/tree/main/transparency`

### Section Numbering Reference Table

To navigate between supplementary materials (which use old numbering from the writing process) and the final article:

| Process Artifacts (old) | Final Article (new)                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| § I                     | § 1: Introduction                     |
| §§ II + III + IV        | § 2: Systemic Barriers (consolidated) |
| § V                     | § 3: Why Engage                       |
| § VI                    | § 4: Dilemma Reconsidered             |
| § VII                   | § 5: Discontinuity                    |
| § VIII                  | § 6: Mandatory Transparency           |
| § IX                    | § 7: Review Mechanism                 |

All process documentation preserves original section numbers. This reflects the ecological validity principle—documentation shows actual process rather than retrospective reconstruction. Use this table when connecting process artifacts to final sections.

### The Five Supplementary Packages

#### SP-1: Complete Prompt (Type 1)

**Location:** `SP1_CompletePrompt/`

~20 pages containing the final synthesized prompt. Contents include: full argument structure (eleven original sections), the "laundering" barrier analysis, incentive gradient examination, the dual solution (discontinuity + mandatory transparency), dual-reviewer mechanism design, tone requirements (dry philosophical prose), and annotated references with relevance assessments.

Used as constant input throughout old §§ I–VI and VIII; temporarily absent for old § VII (new 5). Reviewer B loads this as the primary input when reproducing.

#### SP-2: Reproduction Package (Type 9)

~15–20 pages synthesized from SP-4 materials via preprocessing. Six sections: Architectural Overview, Guidance Patterns Across Sections, Refinement Patterns, Source Integration Approach, Development Flow, and Key Insights Checklist.

[Note: Optimal preprocessing recipe documented in development records; preliminary tests logged as SP5.2.6, with artifacts SP5.3.3–5.]

#### SP-3: Reproduction Guide (Type 10)

~5 pages explaining: how to combine SP-1 and SP-2 for reproduction, trajectory matching criteria (not output matching), pass threshold specification (sufficiency with expected refinement gap), time estimates (≈5–9 hours total), and guidance on when to consult deeper documentation.

#### SP-4: Process Documentation

**Location:** `SP4_ProcessDocumentation/`

All Type 1–7 materials, organized into seven parts (~35–55 pages consolidated):

**Part 1: Complete Prompt (Type 1)**

### Total Volume and Organizational Logic

Approximately 80–110 pages across the five supplementary packages. For basic reproduction, Reviewer B typically needs ~25–45 pages (SP-1, SP-2, SP-3).

SP-4 contains the writing process itself: what guided the work (Complete Prompt, Section Guidance), what changed (Modification Logs), what was learned (Pattern Summaries), what ensured continuity (Section Summaries, Reference Logs), and the foundational traces (Epistemic Traces).

SP-5 documents how guidance evolved: how exploratory material (Type 2) became actionable instructions (Type 1 and Type 3) via structured refinement (Type 8), plus integrity-supporting notes (Type 11).

This separation keeps artifacts used in the writing process (SP-4) distinct from documentation of the evolution of instructions (SP-5).
