# Figure Prompts for Appendix A

## Figure 1: Document Creation Flow

### Overview
Create a horizontal flow diagram showing six phases of document creation from left to right, with varying complexity in each phase. Use a clean, academic style with clear labels and directional arrows. The figure should be vectorial (SVG format preferred) for scaling and editing.

### Design Principles
- Horizontal timeline from left to right
- Clear phase boundaries
- Different visual markers for different document types (use shapes, colors, or line styles)
- Arrows showing information flow and dependencies
- Emphasis on accumulation (stacked/layered effects where documents build up)
- Clear labeling of all document types and phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Writing (Far Left)

**Elements:**
- Two source nodes at foundation:
  - "Epistemic Traces (Type 2)" box
  - Label annotation: "Dual purpose: source material + voice calibration"
  
**Arrows from Epistemic Traces:**
- Arrow → "Prompt Development Log (Type 8)" (show as intermediate node with PDL-XXX label)
- Arrow → "Complete Prompt (Type 1)" (show as final output, ~20 pages noted)

**Visual notes:**
- Use distinct color/shape for Epistemic Traces to emphasize foundational status
- Mark dual arrows to show one-to-many influence

### Phase 2: Main Writing, Sections 1-6 (Center, Repeating Pattern)

**Show 6 section boxes in sequence (label: Section 1, Section 2, ... Section 6)**

**For EACH section, show:**

Inputs (arrows flowing IN):
- Thick constant arrow from Phase 1: "Complete Prompt (Type 1)"
- Thick constant arrow from Phase 1: "Epistemic Traces (Type 2)"
- Growing/stacked arrows from previous sections: "Pattern Summaries (Type 4)" - use layered/stacked visual effect
- Arrows from previous: "Section Summaries (Type 5)"
- Arrows from previous: "Reference Logs (Type 6)" [lighter, as not all sections]
- Arrow for this section: "Section Guidance (Type 3)"

Process within box:
- Simple annotation: "Drafting + Iterative Refinement"
- Special note on Section 5: "13 modifications"

Outputs (arrows flowing OUT):
- "Section Text" (to paper)
- "Modification Log_SX (Type 7)" - note: "MOD-001 restart"
- "Pattern Summary_SX (Type 4)" - arrow continuing forward
- "Section Summary_SX (Type 5)" - arrow continuing forward
- "Reference Log_SX (Type 6)" [if applicable]
- "Section Guidance_SX+1 (Type 3)" - arrow to next section

**Visual emphasis:**
- Show accumulation clearly: Pattern Summaries stack/layer from S1→S2→S3...
- Use stacked boxes or growing arrow widths to show accumulation
- Forward-moving, NOT circular

### Phase 3: Methodology Design Branch (Parallel Track)

**Position:** Between Section 6 and Section 7, branching off main timeline

**Visual:** 
- Show as separate parallel track (different color or dashed border)
- Branch splits from main timeline
- Label: "Asynchronous Work"

**Content in branch:**
- "Preliminary Chats (MOD-M01 through MOD-M37)"
- "Artifact Ontology Development"
- "Section 8 & 9 Guidance (created ahead)"
- "Naming Conventions Established"

**Arrow:**
- Curve back to reconnect to main timeline before Section 7
- Label: "Feeds into SP-5: Development Records"

### Phase 4: Later Writing, Sections 7-9

**Section 7 (Notable difference):**
- Show inputs WITHOUT Complete Prompt (mark absence clearly)
- Annotation: "First absence of Complete Prompt"
- Inputs: Section Guidance, Accumulated Patterns/Summaries only
- Simpler input configuration than Phase 2

**Section 7→8 Transition (Special complexity):**
- Draw curved feedback arrows between Section 7 and Section 8
- Show numbered steps (1-9) in small annotations along curves:
  1. "Preliminary chat for S7 ending"
  2. "Content generated → poor quality"
  3. "Feedback → improved"
  4. "Decision: move to S8 beginning"
  5. "Content repositioned"
  6. "New S8 opening prompt"
  7. "Generated → still unsatisfactory"
  8. "More feedback"
  9. "Final satisfactory version"
- Visual: Looping/curved arrows showing iteration
- Arrow showing content movement from S7 box to S8 box

**Section 8 (Complex inputs):**
- Complete Prompt RETURNS (mark clearly: "Returns after absence")
- Show many input arrows:
  - Complete Prompt (Type 1) - thick arrow
  - Section 8 Guidance
  - Preliminary Chat content (from S7→8)
  - Epistemic Traces
  - Full Pattern Summary collection
  - Guidance from S5→8
  - Guidance from S7→8
  - All accumulated summaries
- Annotation: "Most complex input configuration"

**Section 9:**
- Standard process resumes
- All summaries and patterns (complete collection)

### Phase 5: Post-Draft Editorial Revision (Two Parallel Tracks)

**Show TWO parallel horizontal tracks:**

**Top Track: Language/Tone Revision**
- Boxes for "Section 1 revision" and "Section 6 revision"
- Label: "Exploratory tone"
- Modification Logs document changes

**Bottom Track: CONSOLIDATION EVENT**
- Show three boxes (Section 2, 3, 4) CONVERGING into one box (new Section 2)
- Visual: Three boxes with arrows pointing to single merged box
- Three separate Modification Logs remain (S2, S3, S4)
- Plus one new: "Consolidation Log"

**Cascading renumbering effect:**
- Show old numbering labels transforming to new
- Section 5 (old) → Section 3 (new)
- Section 6 (old) → Section 4 (new)
- Section 7 (old) → Section 5 (new)
- Section 8 (old) → Section 6 (new)
- Section 9 (old) → Section 7 (new)
- Use shifted/cascading visual to show ripple effect

### Phase 6: Appendix (Far Right, Convergence Point)

**Visual:**
- Distinctive shape (different from section boxes - perhaps hexagon or circle)
- Different color or bold outline
- Label: "Appendix A: Nexus of self-reflective experiment"

**Many arrows converging FROM all previous phases:**
- From Phase 2: All Modification Logs
- From Phase 2: All Pattern Summaries
- From Phase 2: All Section Guidance
- From Phase 3: Development Records
- From Phase 4: Preliminary Chats
- From Phase 1: Complete Prompt
- From Phase 1: Epistemic Traces

**Visual emphasis:**
- Many arrows from different phases
- Consider different line colors or styles for different arrow sources
- All pointing toward Appendix box
- Convergence effect

### Legend/Key (Include in figure)

**Document Types (show symbols):**
- Type 1: Complete Prompt
- Type 2: Epistemic Trace
- Type 3: Section Guidance
- Type 4: Pattern Summary
- Type 5: Section Summary
- Type 6: Reference Log
- Type 7: Modification Log
- Type 8: Prompt Development Log

**Arrow Types:**
- Solid thick: Constant input
- Solid thin: Section-specific input
- Dashed: Accumulating forward
- Curved: Feedback/iteration
- Dotted: Branch/reconnection

**Annotations to include:**
- "Forward accumulation (not circular)"
- "Asynchronous work"
- "Consolidation creates renumbering"
- "Convergence point"

### Style Guidelines
- Clean, academic appearance
- High contrast for readability
- Clear labels (readable at standard paper size)
- Professional color palette (avoid too many colors)
- Sufficient spacing between elements
- Arrows should be clearly directional
- Use consistent shapes for same document types across phases

### Size Considerations
- Should fit on one page in landscape orientation
- All text must remain legible when printed at standard paper size
- Consider two-page spread if necessary for clarity
