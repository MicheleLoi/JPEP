# 5.3.9 Architectural Guidance: Integrating Reproduction Procedure into Paper

## Executive Summary

**What we discovered:** A working reproduction procedure (Complete Prompt + X + Reproduction Guide) that embodies the paper's core argument (A+B requirement).

**What the paper should do:** Present the IDEA at appropriate abstraction level for philosophy paper proposing infrastructure. NOT create production system.

**How to structure:**
- **Section 8 (main body):** High-level conceptual description (~1,200-1,500 words)
- **Appendix A:** More detailed elaboration with reference to supplementary materials (~3,000-4,000 words)
- **Supplementary Materials:** Actual implementation artifacts demonstrating concept

## Key Insight: The Paper Embodies Its Own Argument

### The Paper's Argument (Sections 2-4)
1. **Section 2:** Final prompts alone enable strategic underreporting (incentive gradient)
2. **Section 3:** Contiguous venues inherit this problem
3. **Section 4:** Even willing scholars face barriers

### The Solution Embodies A+B Principle
**Component 2 (Section 7):** Mandatory transparency - NOT just prompts
- Prompts alone = Type A (gameable, as Section 2 showed)
- Prompts + process documentation = A+B (resistant to gaming)

**Review Mechanism (Section 8):** Tests sufficiency using A+B
- Complete Prompt (A) + X artifact with traces (B) → reproduction
- This structure directly implements the paper's argument
- Meta-validation: This paper IS the example

---

## Section-by-Section Guidance

### Section 6: The Dilemma Reconsidered (if not yet written)
**Status:** Document 14 shows this is planned
**Purpose:** Show dynamic resolution of Section 3's dilemma

**How reproduction procedure relates:**
- Mention infrastructure enables feedback loops
- "Review mechanism (Section VIII) creates accountability AND enables methodological refinement"
- Forward reference without full explanation
- Show how transparency enables improvement, not just policing

### Section 7: Mandatory Transparency
**Purpose:** Require prompts + process documentation together

**Key moves:**
1. **NOT just prompts** (echo Section 2's critique)
2. **Process documentation includes:**
   - Dialogue traces (where ideas emerged)
   - Refinement logs (how arguments developed)
   - Source integration decisions
   - Section summaries (continuity)

3. **Compiled into reproduction artifact** (mention briefly, detail in Section 8)

4. **Timing:** Submitted with paper (not post-acceptance)

5. **Self-selection:** Only genuinely transparent scholars will submit

**Connection to reproduction:**
"Section VIII explains how this documentation enables sufficiency testing through approximate reproduction."

### Section 8: Review Mechanism (CRITICAL)
**Purpose:** Present split-review system with reproduction-based sufficiency test

**Use the guidance artifact** [section8_guidance] for detailed specifications

**Key principles for Section 8:**

1. **High-level, not technical**
   - Philosophical paper, not CS specification
   - Conceptual clarity, not procedural detail
   - "Appendix A provides additional detail"

2. **Show it embodies A+B argument**
   - Explicit callback to Section 2
   - Show how prompts + traces resist gaming
   - This is the paper's argument in action

3. **Explain reproduction concept**
   - Trajectory matching, not output matching
   - Sufficiency test, not determinism test
   - Pass threshold conceptually described

4. **Two purposes clearly stated**
   - Purpose 1: Sufficiency testing
   - Purpose 2: Authorship anchoring

5. **Reference to implementation**
   - "This paper demonstrates concept"
   - "Appendix A provides detail"
   - "Supplementary materials are worked example"

**What NOT to include in Section 8:**
- Full X structure (6 sections)
- Preprocessing prompts
- Step-by-step reviewer instructions
- Technical details of X generation

**What TO include in Section 8:**
- Split-review architecture
- Reproduction concept (trajectory matching)
- Two purposes (sufficiency + authorship)
- Process documentation package concept (high-level)
- Comparison criteria (conceptual)
- Connection to earlier argument

**Target:** ~1,200-1,500 words

### Section 9: Conclusion
**Key moves:**

1. **Recap the cumulative case:**
   - Incentive problems (Section 2)
   - Structural dilemma (Section 3)
   - Practical barriers (Section 4)
   - Positive motivations (Section 5)
   - Dynamic resolution (Section 6)

2. **The solution architecture:**
   - Two components: discontinuity + mandatory transparency (A+B)
   - Review mechanism: tests sufficiency via reproduction
   - Embodies paper's core argument

3. **This paper as empirical test:**
   - Submitted with full disclosure
   - Either outcome informative
   - Demonstrates feasibility

4. **Call for community development:**
   - This is starting point, not final system
   - Standards will evolve through practice
   - Adaptation encouraged

5. **Implications:**
   - For scholarly publishing
   - For AI-assisted methodology
   - For transparency norms

## Appendix Structure

**Use the guidance artifact** [appendix_structure] for full specifications

**Key sections:**
- A.1: Overview of reproduction procedure
- A.2: The reproduction artifact (X) detailed
- A.3: This paper's documentation as worked example
- A.4: Guide to supplementary materials
- A.5: Reproduction as sufficiency test (elaboration)
- A.6: Relationship to other verification approaches
- A.7: Expected evolution
- A.8: Conclusion

**Tone:** More detailed than Section 8 but still conceptual, not production specification

**Length:** ~3,000-4,000 words

**Purpose:**
- Bridge between Section 8 and supplementary materials
- Provide enough detail to evaluate plausibility
- Guide Reviewer B through materials
- Show how this paper demonstrates concept

---

## Supplementary Materials Organization

**Structure:**
```
Supplementary Materials/
├── SP-1: Complete Prompt
├── SP-2: Reproduction Artifact (X) for Sections 1-3
├── SP-3: Reproduction Guide for Sections 1-3
├── SP-4: Process Documentation
│   ├── MOD Trackers (Level 2)
│   ├── MOD Summaries (Level 3)
│   ├── Section Summaries
│   ├── Epistemic Traces
│   └── Additional Section Prompts
└── SP-5: Conversation Logs (optional)
```

**Appendix A.4** should explain this structure and guide readers through it.

## Critical Design Principles

### 1. Appropriate Abstraction Level
**For each location:**
- **Section 8:** Conceptual (philosopher can evaluate idea)
- **Appendix:** Detailed but not prescriptive (shows plausibility)
- **Supplementary:** Actual artifacts (demonstrates implementation)

### 2. The Meta-Argument
**Throughout, emphasize:**
"This paper demonstrates the concept it proposes. The supplementary materials show what full transparency looks like. The reproduction artifacts enable testing our own claims about sufficiency."

### 3. Intellectual Honesty
**Acknowledge:**
- This is starting point, not final system
- Community calibration needed
- Standards will evolve
- Adaptation expected

### 4. Connection to Argument
**Every description should connect back to:**
- Why prompts alone fail (Section 2)
- Why A+B is necessary
- How this enables transparency without excessive gaming

## What ChatGPT Misunderstood (From Epistemic Trace 2)

**ChatGPT proposed:** Highly technical specifications, conformance levels, detailed artifact schemas, full reviewer checklists

**Why this was wrong:** 
- Paper's goal is to present IDEA and motivate it
- Not to create production-ready system
- Philosophy paper, not engineering specification
- Community standards need to emerge from practice

**Correct approach:**
- Section 8: Conceptual description (can philosophers evaluate this?)
- Appendix: Enough detail to assess plausibility (could this work?)
- Supplementary: Worked example (does it work for this paper?)

**The difference:**
- Prescriptive: "You MUST include these 6 artifacts in exactly this format"
- Descriptive: "This paper includes these artifacts; they demonstrate the concept"

**For writing Section 8 and Appendix:**
- Describe what we did and why it worked
- Show the principles that guided design
- Invite adaptation and evolution
- DON'T prescribe rigid requirements

---

## Revised Workflow Integration (MOD-015)

**Original workflow:** Write paper in single session
**Revised workflow:** Section-by-section with summaries for continuity

**How this relates to reproduction:**
- The section-by-section approach GENERATED the artifacts we're now describing
- Additional Section Prompts document the continuity mechanisms
- Section Summaries enable coherence across sessions
- This workflow IS the process being documented

**For Section 8/Appendix:**
- Mention that section-by-section approach is one valid method
- Note that continuity mechanisms matter
- Don't prescribe this as only way
- Show how it worked for this paper

---

## Section 5 Structural Adjustment (MOD-034)

**What happened:**
- Section 5 initially seemed to solve Section 3's dilemma
- Acknowledged this was incomplete/naive
- Added ending that sets up Section 6
- Distinction: static vs. dynamic perspectives

**Relevance to reproduction procedure:**
- Shows iterative refinement in action
- Demonstrates intellectual honesty (acknowledging limitations)
- This refinement captured in MOD-034
- Part of the process documentation

**For Section 8/Appendix:**
- Can reference this as example of documented refinement
- Shows transparency about process
- Demonstrates that documentation captures genuine development

## Notes on Document Extraction

This architectural guidance was extracted from the October 12-13, 2025 methodology design session (chat ID: 5b8de38b-0044-4726-8eab-75e54460ec3e). The source session generated multiple artifacts documenting the reproduction procedure design process:

- **4.7.3**: Epistemic trace capturing the full conversational development
- **5.3.1**: Modification log with detailed decision tracking
- **5.3.9** (this document): Forward-looking architectural guidance

This document served as planning guidance for writing Sections 8-9 and Appendix A, extracted on January 2, 2026 during final project documentation review.
