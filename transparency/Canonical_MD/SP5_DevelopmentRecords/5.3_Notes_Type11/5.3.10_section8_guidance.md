# Section 8 Guidance: Review Mechanism (Main Body)

## Purpose
Present the split-reviewer system at conceptual level. Make the procedure plausible without full technical specification. Show how it embodies the paper's core argument (A+B requirement).

## Target Length
~1,200-1,500 words (detailed enough to be credible, not so detailed it becomes specification document)

## What Section 8 Must Accomplish

### 1. Establish Split-Review Architecture
- Two independent reviewers with distinct roles
- Reviewer A: Traditional quality assessment (paper only)
- Reviewer B: Sufficiency assessment (process documentation only, initially)
- Editor coordinates and resolves discrepancies

### 2. Explain Reviewer B's Task
**High-level description (not full procedure):**
- Receives process documentation (prompts + dialogue traces + refinement logs + summaries)
- Attempts approximate reproduction using current LLM
- Compares generated work to submitted paper
- Judges: Pass/Fail on sufficiency

**Key concept to introduce:** "Reproduction artifact" or "processed documentation package"
- NOT raw conversation dumps
- Purpose-built compilation from process artifacts
- Author prepares this using their own process materials
- Contains prompts + reasoning traces + refinement patterns + source integration notes

**Critical principle:** Prompts alone insufficient (echoes Section 2's argument). Process documentation shows how author shaped the work.

### 3. Define What "Reproduction" Means
**Avoid technical specification. Present conceptually:**
- NOT expecting identical outputs (stochastic systems, different models)
- Testing: Did author's documented inputs plausibly determine this contribution?
- Comparison focuses on: intellectual trajectory, key insights, argumentative structure
- Expected gap: reproduction will be less polished (this is normal and acceptable)

**Pass threshold (conceptual):**
"The reproduction demonstrates that the documented inputs—prompts, guidance, refinements—were sufficient to generate work of this character. The gap between reproduction and submission reflects expected development, not missing documentation."

### 4. Explain Two Purposes of Reproduction Test

**Purpose 1: Sufficiency Testing**
- Determines if author's input was sufficient for the intellectual contribution
- Not "could LLM do this alone?" but "did author meaningfully shape it?"
- Metaphor options (choose one):
  - Information compression/decompression (prompts as compressed specification)
  - Seed/soil (author input as seed, LLM as rich environment)
  - [Or use analytic philosophy appropriate metaphor]

**Purpose 2: Anchoring Authorship**
- Shows author controlled "the difference that makes the difference"
- Distinguishes genuine guidance from passive acceptance
- Not mere endorsement but meaningful causal control
- Author responsible through intentional structuring

### 5. Address Practical Concerns (Briefly)

**Reviewer burden:**
- Process documentation pre-processed by author (not raw dumps)
- Reproduction attempt is bounded task
- Pass/fail judgment, not extensive analysis
- Comparable to traditional review time commitment

**Gaming concerns:**
- Hard to fabricate credible process documentation
- Prompts + traces together reveal actual process
- Verification possible through spot-checking if reproduction fails
- Self-selection: only genuinely transparent scholars will submit

**Non-determinism:**
- Acknowledged upfront
- Not seeking identical outputs
- Reproduction tests intellectual trajectory, not surface features

### 6. Reference to Appendix and Supplementary Materials

**In main body, include brief note:**
"Appendix A provides additional detail on the reproduction procedure and explains how this paper's own supplementary materials demonstrate the concept. The supplementary materials themselves serve as a worked example of the documentation this venue would require."

**Do NOT:**
- Include full procedural specifications in main body
- List all document types required
- Provide step-by-step instructions for Reviewer B
- Get into technical details of X generation

**DO:**
- Make the concept clear and plausible
- Show how it addresses the paper's core concerns
- Demonstrate it embodies A+B principle
- Reference fuller details available elsewhere

### 7. Connect to Overall Argument

**Callback to Section 2:**
"Section 2 established that final prompts alone enable strategic underreporting. The review mechanism addresses this by requiring process documentation—dialogue traces showing how ideas emerged, refinement patterns revealing the author's guidance, source integration decisions. Together, prompts and process documentation (A+B) resist gaming while remaining practical."

**Callback to Section 7 (mandatory transparency):**
"The mandatory transparency requirement (Section 7) provides the raw materials. The review mechanism transforms these materials into a sufficiency test."

**Forward to Conclusion:**
"This review architecture serves dual purposes: ensuring adequate documentation and enabling methodological learning. The process documentation becomes a scholarly contribution in itself."

## Style Requirements

### Maintain Philosophical Tone
- Conceptual explanation, not procedural manual
- Intellectual justification for design choices
- Acknowledge limitations honestly

### Avoid Over-Specification
- High-level description sufficient
- Details in Appendix/Supplementary
- Focus on principles and rationale

### Use Examples Judiciously
- This paper's materials as proof-of-concept
- Generic descriptions, not exhaustive lists
- Enough detail to be credible, not complete

## Structure Suggestion (Not Prescriptive)

**Opening (~150 words):**
- Transition from Section 7 (mandatory transparency provides materials)
- Split-review architecture overview

**Reviewer Roles (~300 words):**
- Reviewer A: traditional quality assessment
- Reviewer B: sufficiency through reproduction
- Independence and complementarity

**The Reproduction Test (~400 words):**
- What reproduction means (trajectory, not output)
- Process documentation package concept
- Two purposes: sufficiency + authorship anchoring
- Pass threshold (conceptual)

**Addressing Concerns (~300 words):**
- Practical feasibility
- Gaming resistance (A+B together)
- Non-determinism handled
- Reviewer burden bounded

**Connection to Argument (~200 words):**
- Embodies A+B principle from Section 2
- Enables mandatory transparency from Section 7
- Creates methodological learning opportunity

**Transition (~150 words):**
- This paper demonstrates concept
- Appendix provides additional detail
- Supplementary materials are worked example

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**From lessons learned:**
1. Don't over-specify (this isn't implementation document)
2. Don't list exhaustively (keep high-level)
3. Don't get defensive about feasibility (present confidently)
4. Don't repeat earlier sections (reference them)
5. Don't use bullet points in body text (flowing prose)

**New risks for Section 8:**
1. Getting too technical (this is philosophy paper, not CS paper)
2. Under-explaining the concept (must be clear enough to evaluate)
3. Ignoring connection to earlier arguments (this embodies A+B!)
4. Forgetting meta-status (this paper IS the example)

## Success Criteria

After writing Section 8, check:
- [ ] Split-review architecture clear?
- [ ] Reproduction concept understandable?
- [ ] Two purposes explained?
- [ ] Connected to Sections 2 and 7?
- [ ] High-level enough (not over-specified)?
- [ ] Detailed enough (credible and evaluable)?
- [ ] References Appendix appropriately?
- [ ] Maintains philosophical tone?
- [ ] ~1,200-1,500 words?

## Meta-Note

Section 8 is critical because it shows HOW the solution works. It must be:
- Clear enough that philosophers can evaluate the idea
- General enough that it's not prescriptive implementation
- Connected enough to show it addresses earlier critiques
- Honest enough about limitations and challenges

The Appendix will provide more detail. Supplementary materials will demonstrate it working. Section 8 presents the concept at the right level of abstraction for a philosophy paper proposing infrastructure.
