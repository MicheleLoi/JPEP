## SECTION 1: ARGUMENT ARCHITECTURE

  

### Core Arguments by Section

  

**Introduction** establishes a fundamental paradox in current academic publishing: mandatory disclosure policies for AI assistance exist alongside professional cultures that penalize such disclosure. The section identifies this as creating perverse incentives—scholars face strongest pressure to underreport AI involvement precisely when work appears most significant. Four structural gaps are enumerated: (1) no venue for fully disclosed substantial AI-assisted work, (2) no positive case for such scholarship, (3) binary author/tool framework lacking conceptual resources for distributed production, (4) no validation mechanism for disclosures beyond self-reporting.

  

**Section 2 (Incentives Analysis)** explains why the paradox generates systematic dishonesty. Three asymmetric conditions create an incentive gradient: disclosure is permanent (becomes part of career record), significance is uncertain at submission (cannot predict which papers will prove influential), and professional costs are front-loaded (stigma operates immediately). The analysis then identifies four plausible underreporting mechanisms that could operate without conscious fraud, demonstrating how the incentive structure produces predictable responses even among honest scholars.

  

**Section 3 (Why Contiguous Approaches Fail)** demonstrates that obvious solutions face a structural dilemma. Venues maintaining continuity with traditional prestige systems inherit the same incentive problems analyzed in Section 2—the "just in case" reasoning persists wherever work might contribute to career advancement. Venues achieving complete separation risk marginalization and prohibitive opportunity costs, becoming either spaces for unconstrained projects by established scholars or refuges for work unable to meet traditional standards. The dilemma appears intractable: continuity preserves the problem; discontinuity risks irrelevance.

  

### Cumulative Logic Across Sections 1-3

  

The three sections build through progressive deepening of a single insight. **Introduction** surfaces the visible problem—scholars must disclose AI assistance but face professional penalties for doing so. This could be dismissed as mere implementation failure of otherwise sound policies.

  

**Section 2** establishes that the problem is structural, not contingent. The incentive analysis reveals why the paradox generates systematic patterns rather than random individual failures. By identifying the three asymmetries (permanent disclosure, uncertain significance, front-loaded costs), Section 2 demonstrates that the underreporting gradient emerges from the basic architecture of academic credentialing. The four mechanisms (definitional flexibility, temporal discounting, comparative framing, strategic vagueness) then show how underreporting can occur without deliberate fraud. This is crucial: the problem is not bad actors but structural incentives that shape even honest scholars' disclosure practices.

  

**Section 3** extends this structural analysis to proposed solutions. Having established that incentives derive from connection to prestige structures, Section 3 examines whether alternative venues can escape this dynamic. The answer reveals a deeper problem: venues maintaining connection inherit the incentive structure (because "just in case" reasoning applies wherever work might gain prestige), but venues breaking connection risk irrelevance (because disconnection from career advancement creates prohibitive opportunity costs). This is not merely practical difficulty but structural dilemma—each solution precludes what the other requires.

  

### Key Structural Decisions

  

**Why incentives analysis precedes structural dilemma**: The ordering is essential because Section 3's argument depends on Section 2's conclusions. Without establishing that incentive problems derive from connection to prestige structures, the structural dilemma cannot be properly articulated. Section 2 makes the case that the problem is architectural; Section 3 then shows why this architecture constrains possible solutions. Reversing the order would leave Section 3's claims unsupported—readers would not understand why contiguous approaches fail unless they had first internalized the incentive dynamics.

  

**The paper's meta-status**: The work declares itself as AI-assisted scholarship testing its own hypothesis that such work faces systematic barriers in traditional venues. This meta-level move serves multiple functions: (1) provides empirical component to otherwise conceptual argument, (2) demonstrates the methodological transparency being advocated, (3) creates interpretable outcomes regardless of acceptance/rejection, (4) aligns practice with principle (cannot advocate full disclosure while minimizing own AI involvement). The meta-status is not defensive but constitutive of the argument—the paper performs what it proposes.

  

**Dependencies between sections**: Section 3 cannot be written without Section 2 because it must reference (not re-derive) the incentive analysis. The "just in case" reasoning, the three asymmetries, and the underreporting mechanisms are established in Section 2; Section 3 assumes readers have internalized these concepts and shows how they apply to alternative venues. Similarly, Introduction's identification of the four structural gaps sets up the organization of subsequent sections—Section 2 addresses why the paradox exists, Section 3 addresses why obvious solutions fail.

  

### Continuity Mechanisms

  

**Section 3's references to Section 2**: Section 3 must explicitly reference Section 2's conclusions about asymmetries and "just in case" reasoning when analyzing contiguous approaches. However, it should not re-explain these mechanisms—that would create redundancy. Instead, Section 3 references the conclusion (that connection to prestige structures generates incentive problems) and immediately shows application to new cases. The writing assumes readers have internalized Section 2's analysis and need only brief reminders of key concepts.

  

**What readers must internalize from each section**:

- From Introduction: The paradox (transparency required but penalized), the four structural gaps, and the paper's meta-status as empirical test case

- From Section 2: The three asymmetries, how they create an incentive gradient, the concept of "just in case" reasoning, and that underreporting can occur without conscious fraud

- From Section 3: That contiguous approaches inherit incentive problems, that separated approaches risk marginalization, and that this creates a structural dilemma requiring novel solutions

  

The architecture establishes a progression from problem identification (Introduction) to structural explanation (Section 2) to solution constraints (Section 3), with each section depending on conclusions from previous sections while adding genuinely new insights.

## SECTION 2: AUTHOR GUIDANCE PATTERNS

  

The modification trackers and epistemic trace reveal consistent patterns of author intervention across sections 1-3. These patterns demonstrate how human guidance shaped the AI-assisted development process.

  

### 1. Conceptual Reframings

  

**The incentive gradient insight**: The epistemic trace shows a critical reframing moment when the author shifted from viewing the problem as individual dishonesty to recognizing it as structural incentive gradient. The initial framing treated underreporting as moral failure; the author reconceptualized it as predictable response to asymmetric conditions. This reframing appears in the epistemic trace:

  

> "No I'm thinking about whether honesty in reporting involvement is affected for people who actually think their paper may become prestigious"

  

This intervention generated the core insight of Section 2: the most important work has the strongest incentives for dishonesty. The author required moving beyond individual psychology to structural analysis.

  

**Discontinuity framing**: The epistemic trace reveals another major reconceptualization regarding solution design. Initial proposals assumed alternative venues would eventually gain recognition within traditional systems. The author reframed this as "contiguity" that recreates the original problem:

  

> "The problem I see that as long as this is seen as contiguous with the established prestige system, people may even submit a great paper with substantial under reporting just in case"

  

This reframing transformed the solution from "venue seeking eventual validation" to "venue signaling explicit discontinuity," fundamentally reshaping Sections 6-7 of the full paper.

  

**"Just in case" reasoning**: The author identified this specific psychological mechanism as crucial for understanding underreporting dynamics. Rather than assuming authors know papers will be significant, the author emphasized uncertainty at submission creating conservative disclosure strategies. This conceptual tool recurs throughout Sections 2 and 3 as shorthand for the incentive structure's operation.

  

### 2. Refinement Priorities

  

**Epistemic precision for empirical claims**: MOD-19-20 documents extensive revision of Section 2.2 (underreporting mechanisms) to add conditional language. The author recognized that plausible-sounding mechanisms lacked empirical grounding and required explicit epistemological framing. Every mechanism description was revised from declarative ("operates," "involves," "allows") to conditional ("could operate," "might involve," "would allow"). The author added opening frame: "While empirical validation would be required to establish whether and how these mechanisms actually operate in practice, the conceptual analysis demonstrates how underreporting could occur without deliberate fraud."

  

This pattern reflects the author's priority: philosophical analysis must acknowledge its epistemic status. Claims presented as established findings when they are actually candidate explanations undermine rigor. The author enforced systematic distinction between conceptual analysis and empirical demonstration.

  

**Anti-redundancy discipline**: MOD-21 documents two revision rounds specifically targeting redundancy. First, internal redundancy within Section 3 (cutting restatement paragraphs, condensing elaborations). Second, cross-section redundancy between Sections 2 and 3. The author's guidance was explicit:

  

> "Now the problem is redundancy relative to the previous sections... reference, instead of repeating."

  

This established a key principle: each section must reference previous conclusions without re-deriving them. The author cut approximately 550 words from Section 3 (from 1,500 to 950 words) by eliminating re-explanations of Section 2's mechanisms. The standard enforced: trust readers have internalized previous analysis; show application to new cases rather than rehearsing established points.

  

**Citation verification and precision**: MOD-18.1 documents systematic verification of all policy sources (COPE, Elsevier, ACM, Science, Lund & Naheem). The author required confirming URLs, DOIs, and publication dates rather than assuming accuracy. The author also corrected citation format, changing "AI exceptionalism" from quotation marks (suggesting direct citation) to italics (indicating emphasis). This pattern shows the author's standard: every source claim must be verifiable; citation marks must accurately represent source usage.

  

### 3. Attribution/Source Handling

  

**Floridi framing correction**: In Introduction development, the author ensured Floridi's "distant writing" concept was presented cautiously—as emblematic of emerging practices, not as comprehensive framework for academic philosophy. The author prevented overcommitment to Floridi's literary-focused analysis while still using it as effective entry point.

  

**Daily Nous bracketing**: The author carefully limited Daily Nous sources to establish current debate framing without overreliance. Teaching-focused discussions (Jollimore, Berg, Rini) were explicitly bracketed as outside the paper's scope. The author prevented drift toward pedagogical concerns by maintaining clear boundaries around source usage.

  

**Policy source precision**: The author required distinguishing between primary policy sources (COPE guidelines, journal policies) and secondary reporting (Lund & Naheem's study). Each source's specific contribution was identified—COPE establishes authorship criteria, Lund & Naheem documents policy prevalence, journal websites provide direct policy language.

  

### 4. Structural Guidance

  

**Subsection reorganization**: MOD-19 documents combining originally separate subsections 2.1 and 2.2 in Section 2. The author recognized these did not represent genuinely distinct ideas—the asymmetries (2.1) create the gradient (2.2). Separate treatment suggested more logical distance than existed. This triggered comprehensive renumbering and reorganization of Section 2's four final subsections.

  

**Format revision**: MOD-19 documents removing all bullet points and numbered lists from Section 2 body text. The author required conversion to flowing argumentative prose. Similarly, MOD-21 notes that Section 3 must maintain philosophical style without report-like formatting. The pattern: philosophical argumentation uses integrated prose with italicized key terms, not enumerated lists.

  

**Artifact organization**: MOD-18.3 documents separating the Introduction section text from the Preliminary Note and References sections. The author required cleaner organization where section content stands alone, with references accumulated separately for final compilation. This facilitated modular development while maintaining clear boundaries between components.

  

These patterns demonstrate the author's consistent interventions: conceptual precision over initial framings, rigorous epistemic standards for claims, verified source usage, and structural organization supporting philosophical argumentation.

## SECTION 3: REFINEMENT PATTERNS

  

Analysis of MOD-18, MOD-19-20, and MOD-21 reveals recurring refinement patterns across sections 1-3. These patterns identify problems, provide identification criteria, specify corrections, and offer concrete examples.

  

### Pattern 1: Cross-Section Redundancy

  

**Problem**: Later sections re-explain mechanisms or concepts already established in earlier sections, treating readers as if they have not internalized previous analysis. This creates unnecessary length and diminishes cumulative argumentative force.

  

**Identification**: When writing refers to "As Section X established" and then provides full re-explanation rather than brief reference. When similar phrasing, examples, or elaborations appear in multiple sections. When subsection introduces concept as if new despite previous treatment.

  

**Correction**: Reference previous conclusions explicitly but concisely. Assume readers have internalized key concepts from earlier sections. Show application to new cases rather than rehearsing analysis. Cut extended elaborations that merely repeat established points in different contexts.

  

**Example from MOD-21**: Section 3.1 (Contiguous Approach) originally contained ~600 words elaborating how scholars evaluate submissions, re-explaining "just in case" reasoning, walking through "what if this becomes my most-cited work" psychology. Revised version reduced this to ~250 words that (1) describe generic contiguous venue, (2) reference Section 2's analysis in one sentence, (3) show the structure applies here too. Cut ~350 words of re-explanation. The principle: Section 2 already demonstrated the incentive dynamics; Section 3 need only reference this conclusion and show it applies to new venues.

  

### Pattern 2: Epistemic Overconfidence in Ungrounded Claims

  

**Problem**: Presenting plausible hypotheses or conceptual analysis as if they were established empirical findings. Using declarative language ("demonstrates," "operates," "involves") for mechanisms that are candidate explanations requiring empirical validation. This is particularly problematic for AI-assisted work where sophisticated prose can mask lack of evidential grounding.

  

**Identification**: When mechanisms are described with declarative verbs implying actual operation rather than conceptual possibility. When empirical claims lack qualifying language acknowledging uncertainty. When tone suggests certainty beyond what evidence supports. When claims about how things "work" lack caveats about need for validation.

  

**Correction**: Systematically revise declarative language to conditional/modal forms. Add explicit epistemic framing distinguishing conceptual analysis from empirical demonstration. Include acknowledgment that actual operation remains empirical question. Use formulations like "could operate," "might involve," "would allow" rather than "operates," "involves," "allows."

  

**Example from MOD-19**: Section 2 opening originally stated: "This section demonstrates that the resulting incentive structure produces a perverse gradient." Revised to: "This section analyzes how the resulting incentive structure produces a perverse gradient." The word "demonstrates" claims too much—philosophical analysis can show how something could work, not prove that it does work.

  

**Example from MOD-20**: Section 2.2 (Underreporting Mechanism) underwent systematic epistemic revision. Added opening frame: "Several plausible mechanisms can be identified that could operate even among scholars committed to general honesty... While empirical validation would be required to establish whether and how these mechanisms actually operate in practice, the conceptual analysis demonstrates how underreporting could occur without deliberate fraud."

  

Then systematically revised throughout:

- "involves" → "might involve"

- "faces" → "would face"

- "resolves" → "could resolve"

- "naturally privilege" → "might naturally privilege"

- "Authors compare" → "Authors might compare"

- "this framing occurs" → "this framing could occur"

- "The mechanism operates" → "The mechanism would operate"

  

Added concluding acknowledgment: "Whether these mechanisms do in fact operate this way, and to what degree, remains an empirical question requiring systematic study of disclosure practices."

  

### Pattern 3: Internal Redundancy Within Sections

  

**Problem**: Restating points already made within the same section. Using multiple paragraphs to elaborate what could be stated concisely. Including meta-commentary that merely tells readers what was just shown. This reflects LLM tendency toward expansive elaboration.

  

**Identification**: When paragraphs begin with phrases like "Simply put," "The point here is," "In other words." When multiple paragraphs make the same point with slight variations. When conclusion paragraphs merely summarize what preceding paragraphs already stated clearly. When elaboration adds length without adding insight.

  

**Correction**: Cut restatement paragraphs entirely. Condense related points into single paragraphs. Eliminate meta-commentary. Trust readers to understand without excessive hand-holding. Prefer tight argumentation to expansive elaboration. Quality over length.

  

**Example from MOD-21**: Section 3 originally ~1,500 words. First revision pass removed internal redundancy (restatement paragraphs, multi-paragraph elaborations, meta-commentary), reducing to ~1,100 words. Second revision pass addressed cross-section redundancy, reducing to ~950 words. Total reduction of ~550 words while maintaining complete argument. The author's guidance: "Cut ruthlessly in revision."

  

### Pattern 4: Report-Style Formatting in Philosophical Prose

  

**Problem**: Using bullet points, numbered lists, or bold headers for substantive argumentative content. This creates report-like rather than philosophical style. Acceptable in methods sections or appendices, but inappropriate for philosophical argumentation in body text.

  

**Identification**: When substantive points appear as bulleted or numbered lists. When bold headers introduce argument components. When structure resembles organizational report or policy document rather than philosophical essay. When formatting emphasizes enumeration over integration.

  

**Correction**: Convert lists to flowing prose with italicized key terms. Remove bold headers, using italics for conceptual emphasis. Integrate points with transitional phrases showing logical connections. Maintain philosophical style of integrated argument with clear prose structure.

  

**Example from MOD-19**: Section 2.3 (Underreporting Mechanism) originally used bold headers for each mechanism followed by short paragraphs. Revised to remove bold headers, use italics for mechanism names, integrate points with connecting prose. Section 2.3 (Transparency Paradox) originally used bullet-point format for three outcomes. Revised to flowing argumentative prose describing outcomes with italicized key phrases. Section 2.4 (Implications) originally used bullet points for venue characteristics. Revised to integrated prose without bullets.

  

### Pattern 5: Citation Format Precision

  

**Problem**: Inconsistent or imprecise citation formatting. Using quotation marks where emphasis or paraphrase is intended. Failing to verify source accuracy. Not distinguishing between direct citations and conceptual references.

  

**Identification**: When quotation marks appear around phrases not directly quoted from sources. When source claims lack verification (URLs, DOIs, publication dates unchecked). When citation format varies across sections. When attribution suggests direct source when actually paraphrasing or emphasizing.

  

**Correction**: Verify all source details (URLs, DOIs, dates). Use quotation marks only for direct quotes. Use italics for emphasis or conceptual terms. Maintain consistent citation format throughout. Check primary sources rather than assuming accuracy.

  

**Example from MOD-18.1**: Changed "AI exceptionalism" from quotation marks to italics—not directly quoted from Ontiveros & Clay, so quotation marks misrepresent source usage. Verified all policy sources: COPE (added DOI), Elsevier (verified URL), ACM (verified URL and noted September 2025 update), Science (verified URL), Lund & Naheem (verified DOI). Added complete reference entries in standard philosophical format.

  

### Pattern 6: Unclear Structural Transitions

  

**Problem**: Sections or subsections begin without clear connection to previous material. Readers cannot see why content appears in this location or how it advances the argument. This creates impression of list-like organization rather than cumulative building.

  

**Identification**: When subsection begins with new topic without showing connection to previous material. When transition sentences are absent or generic. When organizational logic is unclear. When section endings don't set up what follows.

  

**Correction**: Add explicit transition sentences connecting to previous material. Ensure subsection opening shows relationship to overall argument. Include forward-looking statements in section conclusions that preview next moves. Make organizational logic visible to readers.

  

**Example from Section Summaries**: Introduction ending explicitly previews sections 2-9 with clear characterization of each section's purpose. Section 2 opening connects to Introduction's identification of paradox. Section 2 ending explicitly transitions to Section 3: "Addressing the incentive problem requires more than procedural changes—it requires structural discontinuity from the prestige economy that generates these incentives." Section 3 opening connects to Section 2's conclusion about structural incentives. Section 3 ending notes that both dilemma horns rest on assumptions worth examining, setting up solution sections.

  

### Key Meta-Pattern: Reference, Don't Repeat

  

The most important refinement pattern across all revisions: later sections must reference previous conclusions without repeating previous analysis. Each section should add genuinely new insights while building on internalized previous material. This pattern addresses both philosophical rigor (cumulative argument) and practical efficiency (appropriate length).

  

The author's explicit guidance from MOD-21: "Reference, instead of repeating." This became the controlling principle for Section 3 revision and should govern all subsequent section development.

  

---

  

## SECTION 4: SOURCE INTEGRATION STRATEGY

  

Sources in sections 1-3 fall into three categories: philosophical, empirical/policy, and framing. Each serves distinct argumentative functions with varying integration depths.

  

### Philosophical Sources

  

**Floridi (2025a) - "Distant Writing"**: Primary integration in Introduction opening. Provides conceptual entry point by introducing "distant writing" as literary production in AI age. Paper uses Floridi's concept to establish that transformation in intellectual work production is occurring, then notes limitations for scholarly work (design/execution boundary unclear in philosophy, unlike literary production). Integration is careful—uses Floridi for recognition value and initial framing without overcommitting to framework designed for different domain. The paper does not develop Floridi's "wrAIting" terminology or meta-authorship concept in sections 1-3; these appear later when discussing creativity and tool-mediated production.

  

**Depth**: Moderate. Floridi provides entry point and conceptual legitimacy (established philosopher addressing AI's impact on writing) but paper develops independent analysis of academic publishing incentives. Introduction references Floridi to establish context, then moves to different conceptual terrain.

  

**Floridi (2025b) - "AI as Agency without Intelligence"**: Not used in sections 1-3. Appears in later sections (5-7) when developing positive case for AI-assisted scholarship. Reserved for discussion of philosophical investigation into AI capabilities, Deweyan experimental philosophy, and multiple realizability of agency thesis.

  

### Empirical/Policy Sources

  

**COPE Council (2024)**: Establishes authoritative position that LLMs cannot be authors because they lack accountability and cannot approve final manuscript versions. Provides foundation for Introduction's claim about "near-unanimous consensus" on AI authorship. Used to demonstrate that journal policies uniformly exclude AI from authorship while requiring disclosure.

  

**Depth**: Shallow but authoritative. Single clear position cited to establish consensus. Not developed beyond statement of position.

  

**Elsevier (2023), ACM (2025), Science (2023)**: Provide direct evidence of journal policy landscape. Introduction uses these to show range of major publishers requiring disclosure in methods/acknowledgments sections. Establishes that policies demand transparency but stop short of treating AI as collaborator—reinforces binary author/tool framework.

  

**Depth**: Shallow but evidential. Cited to demonstrate policy prevalence and consistency, not analyzed for nuances. Function is to establish factual landscape against which argument develops.

  

**Lund & Naheem (2023)**: Provides empirical evidence about policy prevalence—over half of major journals have AI policies by 2023. Used in Introduction to establish that disclosure requirements are not isolated cases but systematic feature of academic publishing. Also establishes that policies typically require disclosure in Methods or Acknowledgments sections.

  

**Depth**: Shallow. Single empirical finding cited to establish scope of policy landscape. Paper notes reliance on abstract only, acknowledging limited engagement with full study.

  

### Current Debate Framing Sources

  

**Daily Nous discussions**: Multiple posts (Jollimore 2025, Rini 2025, Berg & Robbins 2024, Ontiveros & Clay 2021, "Two Cultures" 2022) used to establish current philosophical debate landscape. Introduction frames these discussions as "Two Cultures" debate with poles of teaching anxiety versus research optimism, plus moderate voices noting existing delegation practices.

  

**Function**: These sources establish that there IS an active debate in philosophy community about AI, that it has identifiable positions and tensions, and that teaching concerns dominate current discussions. The paper then explicitly brackets pedagogical debates to focus on research publication infrastructure.

  

**Depth**: Very shallow. Used for framing only. Paper does not engage with substantive arguments in these pieces, only uses them to show debate exists and has particular contours. Minimal quotation or analysis. Several sources explicitly noted as having "limited relevance" because they focus on teaching rather than research.

  

**Integration approach**: Quick survey establishing debate landscape, then explicit bracketing. The bracketing itself is important—paper clarifies what it's NOT addressing (pedagogy, learning, student writing) to maintain focus on research infrastructure.

  

### Classical Sources

  

**Plato (Theaetetus 155d), Aristotle (Metaphysics 982b12-13)**: Not used in sections 1-3. Reserved for Section 5 when developing positive motivations, specifically wonder as classical philosophical motivation for inquiry. These sources establish that curiosity about AI capabilities connects to traditional philosophical values.

  

### Integration Strategy Patterns

  

**Hierarchy of Integration**:

1. Floridi: Moderate depth, conceptual legitimacy and entry point

2. Policy sources (COPE, journals, Lund & Naheem): Shallow but factual, establish landscape

3. Daily Nous: Very shallow, framing only, then explicitly bracketed

4. Classical sources: Reserved for later sections, not used in 1-3

  

**Strategic Minimalism**: Sections 1-3 maintain lean source usage. Philosophy papers are argument-driven, not literature-review-driven. Sources establish context (Floridi), document factual landscape (policies), and frame current debates (Daily Nous), but the argument develops through logical analysis of incentive structures rather than extensive engagement with existing literature.

  

**Verification Standards**: MOD-18.1 documents careful verification of all policy sources—URLs checked, DOIs confirmed, publication dates verified. This establishes methodological standard: every factual claim about policies must be traceable to verified source.

  

**Source Function Clarity**: Each source has clear, limited function. Floridi establishes conceptual context. COPE establishes authorship consensus. Journal policies document requirements. Lund & Naheem documents prevalence. Daily Nous frames debate. None is asked to do more work than appropriate. This prevents overreliance on any single source and maintains argumentative independence.

  

### What Sources DON'T Provide

  

The sources establish context and document landscape, but they do NOT provide:

- The incentive analysis (Section 2): Original conceptual work

- The structural dilemma (Section 3): Original analysis

- The "just in case" reasoning: Original psychological insight

- The four underreporting mechanisms: Original conceptual analysis (though epistemically marked as hypothetical)

- The solution architecture: Developed in sections 6-8

  

The paper's argument is primarily original philosophical analysis. Sources provide legitimacy, context, and factual grounding, but the core insights emerge from reasoning about incentive structures rather than from synthesis of existing literature.

## SECTION 5: SECTION DEVELOPMENT FLOW

  

### Introduction (Section 1 in final paper numbering)

  

**Word count**: ~1,400 words  

**Status**: Complete, author-approved

  

**Core argument**: Current academic publishing creates a paradox where mandatory disclosure policies for AI assistance exist alongside professional cultures that penalize such disclosure. This generates perverse incentives—scholars face strongest pressure to underreport AI involvement precisely when work appears most significant. Four structural gaps prevent addressing this problem: no venue for fully disclosed work, no positive case for AI-assisted scholarship, binary author/tool framework, and no validation mechanism beyond self-reporting.

  

**Builds on**: Nothing (opening section). Establishes foundation for entire paper.

  

**Sets up**: Section 2 (incentive analysis) and Section 3 (why obvious solutions fail). The four gaps structure remaining sections—gap 1 requires alternative venue proposal, gap 2 requires positive motivations (Section 5), gap 3 informs review mechanism (Section 8), gap 4 requires validation procedures.

  

**Key subsections** (implicit organizational units):

- Opening frame: Floridi's distant writing

- Current debates: Two cultures framing (teaching panic vs research potential)

- Policy landscape: Universal AI-cannot-be-author position, mandatory disclosure

- The paradox: Transparency required but penalized

- Four structural gaps: Enumerated with brief explanation

- Paper's meta-status: Submission trajectory as empirical test

- Roadmap: Preview of sections 2-9

  

**Critical moves**:

- **Bracketing pedagogy explicitly**: Acknowledges teaching debates but clarifies paper focuses on research infrastructure. Prevents drift into pedagogical concerns.

- **Meta-status declaration**: States paper's own AI-assisted production and frames submission as empirical test. This is essential to paper's argumentative strategy—cannot advocate transparency while hiding own methodology.

- **Four gaps enumeration**: Provides organizational spine for entire paper. Each gap corresponds to solution component.

- **Tone establishment**: Dry philosophical prose without emotional appeals. Models rigor while discussing potentially controversial topic.

  

### Section 2: Incentives Analysis

  

**Word count**: ~1,400 words  

**Status**: Complete (underwent major revisions in MOD-19-20)

  

**Core argument**: Current publishing policies create perverse incentive structure where scholars face strongest temptation to underreport AI involvement precisely in work they regard as most significant. Three asymmetric conditions (permanent disclosure, uncertain significance, front-loaded professional costs) create an incentive gradient. Four plausible mechanisms enable underreporting without conscious dishonesty. The result is transparency paradox where disclosure requirements produce minimal substantive transparency.

  

**Builds on Introduction**: Takes Introduction's identified paradox (transparency required but penalized) and provides structural explanation for WHY it produces systematic patterns rather than random individual failures. Transforms observation of paradox into analysis of mechanism.

  

**Sets up Section 3**: Establishes that incentive problems derive from connection to prestige structures. This conclusion becomes premise for Section 3's analysis—any venue maintaining connection to prestige structures will inherit these incentive dynamics. Without Section 2's analysis, Section 3's argument about contiguous approaches failing would lack foundation.

  

**Key subsections**:

1. **The Incentive Gradient** (~350 words): Establishes three asymmetries and shows how they create gradient where higher perceived significance correlates with lower reported AI involvement.

  

2. **The Underreporting Mechanism** (~500 words): Identifies four plausible mechanisms (definitional flexibility, temporal discounting, comparative framing, strategic vagueness) that could allow underreporting through sincere belief rather than deliberate fraud. Heavily revised in MOD-20 to add epistemic humility—framed as conceptual analysis requiring empirical validation.

  

3. **The Transparency Paradox** (~300 words): Describes three paradoxical outcomes (inverted relationship, minimal disclosure, selection effects) that emerge from incentive structure. Establishes that disclosure policies create formal compliance without substantive transparency.

  

4. **Implications for Venue Design** (~250 words): Draws conclusion that any venue positioning itself as contiguous with traditional prestige systems will inherit these incentive problems. Sets up Section 3's analysis.

  

**Critical moves**:

- **Asymmetry identification**: The three conditions (permanent, uncertain, front-loaded) are the key conceptual contribution. These explain why disclosure decisions are not neutral but systematically biased.

- **"Just in case" reasoning**: This phrase captures the psychological mechanism driving underreporting. Becomes shorthand used throughout paper.

- **Epistemic framing (MOD-20)**: Adding conditional language and explicit acknowledgment that mechanisms are conceptual analysis, not established findings. This models appropriate philosophical rigor for AI-assisted work.

- **Transition to venue design**: Explicit forward-looking conclusion connecting incentive analysis to structural solutions.

  

**Revision history**: Combined originally separate subsections 2.1 and 2.2 (asymmetry and gradient are single idea). Removed all bullet points and lists, converted to flowing prose. Added systematic epistemic humility language throughout 2.2. Result: ~1,400 words with tighter integration and appropriate epistemological framing.

  

### Section 3: Why Contiguous Approaches Fail

  

**Word count**: ~950 words (reduced from original ~1,500)  

**Status**: Complete (underwent major redundancy revision in MOD-21)

  

**Core argument**: Alternative venues for AI-assisted scholarship face a structural dilemma. Maintaining continuity with traditional prestige systems means inheriting the same incentive problems analyzed in Section 2—the "just in case" reasoning persists wherever work might contribute to career advancement. Achieving complete separation risks marginalization through prohibitive opportunity costs and potential perception as refuge for substandard work. The dilemma appears intractable: continuity recreates the problem; discontinuity risks irrelevance.

  

**Builds on Section 2**: Assumes readers have internalized the three asymmetries, the incentive gradient, and the "just in case" reasoning. Section 3 does NOT re-explain these mechanisms—it references Section 2's conclusion that incentive problems derive from connection to prestige structures, then shows this conclusion applies to alternative venues. The heavy revision in MOD-21 specifically targeted cross-section redundancy, cutting ~350 words of re-explanation.

  

**Sets up Section 4**: Establishes that both obvious solutions (contiguity and separation) face fundamental problems. This creates space for Section 4 to add one more barrier (unfair reviews) before pivoting to positive motivations and novel solution architecture in sections 5-8. The forward-looking conclusion notes both dilemma horns rest on assumptions worth examining, preparing readers for solution that challenges those assumptions.

  

**Key subsections**:

1. **The Contiguous Approach and Its Failure** (~350 words): Describes venues bridging current practice and emerging methodologies. Shows how Section 2's asymmetries remain operative if work could count for career advancement. Originally ~600 words; reduced by cutting re-explanation of Section 2's mechanisms.

  

2. **The Separation Alternative and Its Failure** (~350 words): Examines explicit discontinuity from traditional infrastructure. Shows why this addresses incentives (no career advancement = no "just in case" reasoning) but creates ghetto problem (prohibitive opportunity costs, potential marginalization, knowledge-production difficulties).

  

3. **The Dilemma's Structure** (~150 words): Synthesizes structural tension. Continuity → inherit incentive problems; Discontinuity → risk irrelevance. Presents as genuinely structural, not merely practical difficulty.

  

4. **Toward Resolution** (~100 words): Brief forward-looking transition noting dilemma may not be intractable. Both horns depend on assumptions worth examining. Sets up subsequent sections without revealing solutions.

  

**Critical moves**:

- **Lean referencing**: Section 3.1 references Section 2's analysis in single sentence, then immediately shows application. Does not re-walk through asymmetries or elaborate psychology. Trusts readers have internalized previous section.

- **Balanced treatment**: Both contiguity and separation problems given appropriate weight. Neither horn dismissed or strawmanned. Genuine dilemma presented.

- **Generic approach**: No specific journals or venues analyzed. Keeps argument abstract and structural rather than about particular institutional actors.

- **Transition economy**: Forward-looking conclusion is brief (~100 words) rather than extended preview. Sets up next move without over-elaborating.

  

**Revision history**: Two major rounds in MOD-21. First cut internal redundancy (restatement paragraphs, multi-paragraph elaborations) from ~1,500 to ~1,100 words. Second cut cross-section redundancy (re-explanations of Section 2's mechanisms) from ~1,100 to ~950 words. Total reduction ~550 words while maintaining complete argument. Key principle established: reference previous conclusions, don't re-derive them.

  

### Cumulative Building Pattern Across Sections 1-3

  

**Introduction** identifies problem: Paradox exists (transparency required but penalized), four gaps remain unaddressed.

  

**Section 2** explains mechanism: Shows WHY paradox produces systematic patterns through three asymmetries creating incentive gradient. Establishes structural rather than individual problem.

  

**Section 3** constrains solutions: Shows why obvious approaches fail—continuity inherits problem, discontinuity risks irrelevance. Establishes that solution must navigate genuine dilemma.

  

**Continuity mechanisms in action**:

- Section 2 opening references Introduction's paradox: "Current journal policies...demand disclosure while professional norms discourage it" (assumes readers know this from Introduction)

- Section 3 opening references Section 2's conclusion: "Given this analysis of how prestige structures generate incentive gradients..." (assumes readers have internalized Section 2)

- Section 3.1 uses "just in case" reasoning as established shorthand from Section 2

- Section 3.2 can contrast separation approach because readers already understand contiguity problem from 3.1

  

**Word count progression**: Introduction and Section 2 both ~1,400 words (establishing foundation and mechanism). Section 3 more economical at ~950 words (applying established concepts to new case). Each section appropriately weighted for its function in cumulative argument.

  

**Quality standard maintained**: Heavy revision in MOD-19-20-21 demonstrates priority on tight argumentation over length. Philosophy paper values precision and economy over comprehensive elaboration. Each section says what needed, no more.

## SECTION 6: KEY INSIGHTS CHECKLIST

  

Essential insights from sections 1-3 that MUST appear in any reproduction. Formulated as single-sentence core claims organized by section.

  

### FROM INTRODUCTION

  

1. Academic journals require disclosure of AI assistance (near-unanimous consensus, documented by COPE, major publishers, Lund & Naheem study) while professional culture simultaneously penalizes such disclosure through reviewer resistance and reputational costs.

  

2. This creates a paradox where transparency is mandatory but professionally costly, generating perverse incentives for scholars to minimize reported AI involvement.

  

3. Four structural gaps remain unaddressed in current debates: no venue for fully disclosed substantial AI-assisted work, no positive case for such scholarship, binary author/tool framework lacking conceptual resources for distributed production, and no validation mechanism for disclosures beyond self-reporting.

  

4. The paper itself constitutes an empirical test case—submitted with full AI-assistance disclosure, its acceptance or rejection provides evidence about whether traditional venues can handle transparent AI-assisted work.

  

5. Current debates divide between teaching anxiety (concerns about student learning, academic integrity in courses) and research potential (AI as tool for philosophical investigation), with pedagogical concerns dominating discussions.

  

6. This paper explicitly brackets teaching and learning issues to focus on research publication infrastructure, maintaining clear scope boundaries.

  

### FROM SECTION 2: INCENTIVES ANALYSIS

  

7. Three asymmetric conditions create an incentive gradient: disclosure is permanent (becomes part of permanent scholarly record), significance is uncertain at submission (cannot predict which papers will prove influential), and professional costs are front-loaded (stigma operates immediately regardless of eventual reception).

  

8. These asymmetries create predictable pattern where perceived work significance and reported AI involvement are inversely correlated—minor work carries low disclosure costs while potentially career-defining work creates maximum incentive to underreport.

  

9. "Just in case" reasoning captures the psychological mechanism: scholars may conservatively underreport AI involvement for work that might (even with low probability) become highly significant, because disclosure becomes permanently attached to career-defining assets.

  

10. Four plausible underreporting mechanisms could operate without conscious dishonesty: definitional flexibility (terms like "substantial AI assistance" lack precise boundaries), temporal discounting (privileging later human-heavy revision over earlier AI-heavy exploration), comparative framing (comparing to hypothetical greater AI dependence rather than traditional unassisted scholarship), and strategic vagueness (minimal disclosure satisfying formal requirements while obscuring actual involvement).

  

11. These mechanisms could allow underreporting through sincere belief in accounts that happen to serve professional interests—authors may genuinely believe their characterizations while systematically minimizing reported involvement.

  

12. The transparency paradox produces three outcomes: inverted relationship (where transparency matters most, we get least), minimal disclosure (formal compliance without substantive transparency resembling tax code compliance), and selection effects (scholars committed to transparency may self-select out of prestigious venues).

  

13. Any venue positioning itself as contiguous with traditional prestige systems will inherit the same incentive problems because authors face identical "just in case" reasoning wherever work might count for career advancement or citation in prestigious outlets.

  

### FROM SECTION 3: WHY CONTIGUOUS APPROACHES FAIL

  

14. Venues maintaining continuity with traditional prestige structures inherit the incentive problems from Section 2—if work published there could contribute to tenure, traditional metrics, or prestigious recognition, the three asymmetries remain operative and "just in case" reasoning persists.

  

15. Complete separation from prestige structures addresses the incentive problem (no career advancement value = no "just in case" reasoning loses purchase) but risks marginalization through prohibitive opportunity costs.

  

16. The "ghetto problem" describes how separated venues risk becoming either spaces for established scholars' unconstrained projects (where quality standards may be relaxed) or refuges for work unable to meet traditional standards, in either case undermining the goal of understanding how quality AI-assisted scholarship actually works.

  

17. This creates a structural dilemma: continuity with prestige structures recreates the incentive problem; discontinuity from prestige structures risks irrelevance and marginalization.

  

18. The dilemma is genuinely structural, not merely practical—each horn precludes what the other requires (continuity preserves transparency problem while seeking relevance; discontinuity solves transparency problem while risking irrelevance).

  

19. Both horns of the dilemma rest on assumptions worth examining: whether relevance depends entirely on traditional prestige markers, whether opportunity costs must be framed as "time that doesn't count," and whether value could be grounded in methodological contribution rather than career advancement.

## SYNTHESIS NOTE FOR REPRODUCTION

  

This artifact provides the essential architecture for reproducing Sections 1-3. Key points for reproduction:

  

**Argument Structure**: The three sections build progressively—problem identification (Introduction) → structural explanation (Section 2) → solution constraints (Section 3). Each section must reference but not repeat previous conclusions.

  

**Tone and Style**: Dry philosophical prose. No bullet points in body text. Flowing argumentation with italicized key terms. Epistemic humility for empirical claims. No emotional appeals.

  

**Critical Concepts**: The three asymmetries, "just in case" reasoning, four underreporting mechanisms, transparency paradox, contiguity/discontinuity tension, structural dilemma. These must appear in specific sections as indicated.

  

**Meta-Strategy**: Paper's own AI-assisted production is not defensive footnote but constitutive of argument. Performs what it proposes.

  

**Quality Standard**: Lean argumentation over length. Reference previous sections' conclusions concisely. Cut redundancy ruthlessly. Trust readers to follow analysis.

  

**Source Usage**: Floridi for entry point, policy sources for landscape, Daily Nous for debate framing (then bracketed), minimal but verified citations.

  

**Word Count Targets**: Introduction ~1,400 words, Section 2 ~1,400 words, Section 3 ~950 words. Approximately 3,750 words total across three sections.

  

This synthesis is designed to enable a reviewer using a current LLM to reproduce the essential argumentative structure, key insights, and philosophical style of Sections 1-3.
