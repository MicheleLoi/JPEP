# 5.2.6.1 First Development of SP2 (Reproduction Package and Procedure)

5.2.6.1 First Development of SP2 (Reproduction Package and Procedure)
Overview
Date: 12-13 October 2024 [Reconstructed 9/11/2025
Session Type: Prompt Development and Testing
Outputs: "X" artifact [now: SP2.1], "Reproduction prompt" [now: SP2.2], and generation prompt for X [now: SP5.4]
Location in Paper: Referenced in Appendix A; generation prompt logged as Note 5.3.3; test artifacts logged as Notes 5.3.4 and 5.3.5
Purpose and Challenge
This session developed the reproduction system enabling Reviewer B's reproduction attempt. The central challenge was creating a reusable, generic prompt that could work across different papers while producing purpose-built reproduction materials.
Key Design Constraint: The prompt must examine whatever process documentation authors provide and synthesize it into ~10-12 pages that enable trajectory-matching reproduction, not merely compile existing materials.
Inputs to This Development Session
Foundation Document
Complete Prompt (SP1): Already specified systematic artifact collection (prompt transcripts, dialogue records, modification trackers) and stated the paper would document its own creation (Section VIII: Mandatory Transparency)
Process Documentation from Sections I-VI
Epistemic Traces 4.7.1 and 4.7.2: Key dialogue moments showing argument development
Prompt Development Log 5.1: Evolution of Complete Prompt itself (MODs 1-17)
Summary Collection (I-VI): Condensed argument flow for completed sections
Modification Trackers (I-VI): Detailed revision logs for each section
Critical Context
The Complete Prompt already contained the documentation vision. This session's task was to operationalize that vision into a concrete procedure: determining what specific artifacts enable reproduction and how to synthesize them efficiently.
Input Requirements Analysis
Initial Question: What Documentation Is Necessary?
The session began by examining existing process artifacts to determine minimum sufficient inputs for reproduction.
Discovery 1: Two Levels of Modification Documentation
Existing materials revealed two distinct artifact types:
Modification Logs ("Level 2" or "large MOD trackers"): Detailed revision records with specific changes and rationales
Example: MOD-19-20 documents 13 iterations on Section 2, including exact epistemic humility corrections
Pattern Summaries ("Level 3" or "MOD summaries"): Generalizable lessons extracted from Modification Logs
Example: "Section 5: Lessons Learned" synthesizes 11 reusable refinement principles
Key Question: Can the generation prompt work from Level 3 alone (already compressed), or does it need Level 2 (detailed logs)?
Test Case: Section 5 Comparison
To resolve this, the session compared what Level 2 vs. Level 3 captured for Section 5:
What Level 3 Captured:
General refinement patterns (eliminate redundancy, use epistemic humility)
Process principles for future writing
Meta-lessons about collaboration
What Level 2 Contained That Level 3 Lost:
Structural decisions: "Section 5 has exactly TWO subsections" (not three or four)
Argumentative role: "Wonder solves Section 3's dilemma" (not just a motivation)
Pedagogical ordering: "Modular synthesis → computer art → AI-philosophy" (specific sequence matters)
Integration decisions: "Extended mind in subsection 2" (not separate)
Ending requirements: "Acknowledge limitation; distinguish static vs. dynamic; set up Section 6"
Conclusion: Level 2 contains implementation knowledge—decisions made during writing that aren't in the original Complete Prompt and aren't captured by general patterns. Level 3 provides refinement principles but loses section-specific choices.
Decision: The generation prompt must accept both Level 2 and Level 3 as inputs. Level 3 makes pattern extraction easier; Level 2 provides specificity reproduction requires.
Additional Section Prompts: High-Value But Not Required
The session identified a third artifact type: Session Prompts (forward-looking inputs for writing subsequent sections, showing continuity mechanisms and methodological guidance).
Examples:
"SESSION PROMPT: Write Section 4" - explicit instructions
"Section 5: Synthesis for Continuity" - contextual summary
Decision: Include these in generation prompt specifications as high-value when available but not mandatory. After successful test without them, they were reclassified as "documentation" rather than required inputs (proof-of-concept approach, not prescriptive system).
Six-Section Structure Development
The generation prompt produces an "X" artifact [now: SP2.1] with exactly six sections. Each section's purpose emerged from analyzing what reproduction requires:
Section 1: Argument Architecture (~2 pages)
Purpose: Show cumulative logic, not content summary
Why needed: Reproduction must understand dependencies between sections
Draws from: Complete Prompt + Section Summaries
Design insight: Initial drafts focused on "what each section argues." Testing revealed reproduction needs "why sections ordered this way" and "what must readers have internalized from previous sections."
Section 2: Author Guidance Patterns (~2-3 pages)
Purpose: Extract intervention patterns by type, not chronologically
Why needed: Shows how author shaped work; enables similar guidance in reproduction
Draws from: Epistemic Traces + Modification Logs
Design categories:
Conceptual reframings (major reconceptualizations)
Refinement priorities (what author emphasized repeatedly)
Attribution/source handling (precision requirements)
Structural guidance (reorganization triggers)
Section 3: Refinement Patterns (~2 pages)
Purpose: Synthesize patterns that recurred across sections
Why needed: Enables refining generated reproduction draft
Draws from: Modification Logs (primarily Level 2)
Design insight: Don't list every MOD entry—extract patterns (redundancy elimination, epistemic precision, style discipline) with problem→identification→correction→example structure.
Section 4: Source Integration Strategy (~1-2 pages)
Purpose: Categorize sources by type and show integration depth
Why needed: Enables appropriate citation in reproduction
Draws from: Complete Prompt (reference sections) + any verification notes
Design approach: Distinguish philosophical (deep engagement), empirical (evidential), policy (documentation), classical (legitimation) sources.
Section 5: Section Development Flow (~2 pages)
Purpose: Show how sections build cumulatively
Why needed: Captures pacing and continuity mechanisms
Draws from: Section Summaries + Modification Logs (for specifics)
Design structure: For each section: core argument, builds on previous, sets up next, key subsections, critical moves.
Section 6: Key Insights Checklist (~1 page)
Purpose: List essential insights that must appear for pass judgment
Why needed: Comparison criteria for reproduction vs. submitted paper
Draws from: Complete Prompt + Section Summaries + synthesis from Sections 1-5
Design format: Numbered list (15-25 insights), one-sentence formulations, organized by section or theme.
Prompt Refinement: From Specific to Generic
Initial Draft Problem
First version contained paper-specific content:
SECTION 2: INCENTIVES ANALYSIS
- Establish three asymmetries (disclosure permanent, 
  significance uncertain, costs front-loaded)
- Develop incentive gradient
- Explain underreporting mechanisms
[etc.]
Issue: This makes prompt unusable for other papers.
User Correction
"The prompt itself should be generic - reusable. Not based on the contents of the inputs. Examining the content of the inputs is the task of the process."
Revised Approach
Final prompt provides instructions for examining inputs, not content specifications:
SECTION 1: ARGUMENT ARCHITECTURE
Examine: Complete Prompt + Section Summaries
Your task:
1. Identify how many sections the paper has
2. Explain the cumulative logic
3. Identify key structural decisions
[etc.]
Key shift: Prompt tells the AI how to analyze whatever materials are provided, rather than what to find in this specific paper.
Testing Configuration
Scope Decision: Sections 1-3 Only
Rationale:
Keep X-generation manageable for initial test
Use completed material only
Verify pattern extraction works
Confirm ~6-8 pages sufficient for 3 sections
Success criterion: If successful, scale to full paper with proportionally longer output (~10-12 pages for sections 1-5).
Test Input Specification
Minimum required documents (from original set):
Document 4: Complete Prompt
Document 13: Section Summaries (Intro, Sections 2-4)
Document 9: Modification Log - Section 5 (most detailed example)
Document 1: Epistemic Trace (key dialogue)
Strongly recommended additions:
Document 7: Modification Log - Introduction
Document 8: Modification Log - Section 2 (epistemic humility patterns)
Document 11: Modification Logs - Sections 3-4 (redundancy elimination)
Document 3: Prompt Development Log (shows Complete Prompt evolution)
Expected Output Characteristics
Generated "X" [now: SP2.1] should:
Be ~6-8 pages total (for 3 sections)
Contain all six sections in specified order
Extract patterns (not list everything from inputs)
Be coherent and purpose-built (not disconnected sections)
Enable trajectory-matching reproduction (structural similarity + key insights)
Critical Design Decisions
1. Single-Pass Preprocessing
Decision: One prompt generates entire "X" artifact from process documentation.
Alternative considered: Generate six separate artifacts (X1-X6), then compile.
Why rejected: Creates unnecessary complexity. Single coherent synthesis serves reproduction better.
2. Purpose-Built, Not Compilation
Decision: "X" reorganizes and synthesizes information specifically for reproduction task.
Alternative considered: Just compile all process artifacts and give to reviewer.
Why rejected:
Attention window constraints (compilation could exceed 100 pages)
Reviewer burden (must extract patterns themselves)
Not optimized for reproduction purpose
3. Both Levels Required
Decision: Accept both Modification Logs (Level 2) and Pattern Summaries (Level 3) as inputs.
Alternative considered: Use only Level 3 (already compressed).
Why rejected: Testing showed Level 3 alone loses section-specific implementation decisions crucial for reproduction.
4. Generic Structure
Decision: Prompt examines any inputs provided; doesn't assume specific content.
Alternative considered: Template with paper-specific fill-in-the-blank sections.
Why rejected: Not reusable across different papers. Generic prompt enables broader applicability.
Testing and Validation
Test Configuration
Scope: Sections 1-3 only (Introduction, Incentives Analysis, Why Contiguous Approaches Fail)
Input documents provided:
Complete Prompt (Document 4) - base instructions
Section Summaries (Document 13) - sections 1-3 coverage
Modification Logs - Introduction (Document 7), Section 2 (Document 8), Sections 3-4 (Document 11)
Modification Log - Section 5 (Document 9) - most detailed example
Epistemic Trace - Core Arguments (Document 1)
Optional: Prompt Development Log (Document 3)
Test procedure:
Use generation prompt [now: SP5.4, Note 5.3.3] to create "X" [now: type SP2.1, tested prototype in note 5.3.3] from these inputs
Evaluate generated "X" against success criteria
Use "X" + Complete Prompt with "reproduction prompt" [now: type SP2.2, tested prototype in Note 5.3.5] to generate sections 1-3
Compare generated sections to actual submitted sections
Success Criteria
For generated "X" [now: type SP2.1, 5.3.4]:
~6-8 pages total
Contains all six sections in specified order
Section 1 explains cumulative logic (not content summary)
Section 2 organized by guidance type (not chronological)
Section 3 shows refinement patterns across sections
Section 6 provides clear checklist
Coherent and purpose-built (not disconnected compilation)
For reproduction test:
Generated sections show structural similarity
Key insights from checklist appear
Refinement patterns applied (especially Section 3 referencing not repeating Section 2)
Comparable philosophical sophistication
Expected gap (rougher, less polished) acceptable
Test Results
"X" generated: See Note 5.3.4 - "Experimental SP2 (X for sections 1-3)" [current designation: SP2.1 test version]
Result: Successfully generated ~6-8 page package with all six sections demonstrating:
Cumulative architecture explanation
Author guidance patterns extracted by type
Refinement patterns (redundancy elimination, epistemic humility)
Source integration strategy
Section development flow
15-20 key insights checklist
Reproduction test conducted: Using Complete Prompt + "X" [5.3.4] with "reproduction prompt" [5.3.5]
Result: Achieved sufficiency. Generated sections 1-3 demonstrated:
Structural similarity (three-section cumulative argument present)
Key insights present (three asymmetries, "just in case" reasoning, structural dilemma)
Refinement patterns applied (Section 3 referenced Section 2 without repetition)
Comparable depth (philosophical sophistication adequate)
Expected quality gap (rougher prose, less development) within acceptable bounds
Validation: Test proved that Complete Prompt + "X" (generated via generation prompt) provides sufficient inputs for trajectory-matching reproduction. The documentation captures what determined the intellectual contribution.
Implications for Full Paper
Scaling decision: Test success with 3 sections (~6-8 pages) validates approach. For full paper (sections 1-5):
Expected "X" length: ~10-12 pages
Same six-section structure
Proportionally more examples across sections
Same synthesis principles apply
Proof of concept: This paper's supplementary materials will include the full "X" for the entire paper [now: SP2.1] generated via this process, demonstrating the procedure on the paper itself.

Summary
This session operationalized the Complete Prompt's documentation vision by developing a reproduction system. Key outputs: (1) generic generation prompt [now: SP5.4] that synthesizes process artifacts into "X" [now: SP2.1], (2) "X" artifact containing six sections of synthesized knowledge, (3) "reproduction prompt" [now: SP2.2] providing instructions for using "X" with Complete Prompt to attempt reproduction. Key innovations: recognizing both detailed logs and pattern summaries are needed, creating generic six-section structure, designing for synthesis rather than compilation, validating through successful test on sections 1-3 achieving sufficiency. The resulting system enables authors to generate reproduction materials that allow trajectory-matching reproduction attempts.
