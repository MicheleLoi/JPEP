## Section II: Incentive Analysis

### Metrics, Gaming, and Perverse Incentives

**RECOMMENDED CITATION - Goodhart's Law:**

**Strathern, M. (1997).** "'Improving ratings': Audit in the British university system." *European Review*, 5(3), 305–321.  
https://doi.org/10.1017/S1062798700002660

**Verbatim formulation:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

**Usage note:** This is the most widely quoted formulation in humanities/philosophy contexts. Use when discussing how prestige metrics create perverse incentives.

**Suggested placement in Section II:** When discussing prestige gradient and gaming incentives.

**LaTeX footnote example:**
```latex
As Strathern observes, "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."\footnote{Strathern, M. (1997). "'Improving ratings': Audit in the British university system." \textit{European Review}, 5(3), 305–321.}
```

**Status:** RECOMMENDED FOR ADDITION TO SECTION II

---

**ALTERNATIVE/ADDITIONAL CITATION - Campbell's Law:**

**Campbell, D. T. (1979).** "Assessing the impact of planned social change." *Evaluation and Program Planning*, 2(1), 67–90.  
https://doi.org/10.1016/0149-7189(79)90048-X

**Campbell's Law:** "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor."

**Usage note:** Earlier formulation (predates Strathern), from evaluation/sociology. More technical framing. Use if discussing systematic gaming of metrics or corruption of indicators.

**Status:** OPTIONAL - Consider if deeper discussion of metric gaming needed

---

**ORIGINAL SOURCE - Goodhart's Law:**

**Goodhart, C. A. E. (1975).** "Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience." In *Papers in Monetary Economics* (Vol. 1). Reserve Bank of Australia.

**Usage note:** Original economic formulation. Cite if discussing origins of the principle or making connection to economic theory.

**Status:** OPTIONAL - Primary citation should be Strathern (1997) for humanities audience

## Section VI: The Dilemma Reconsidered

**Status:** Section complete, no new references required beyond those already in Introduction and Section V.

**Note:** Section VI references transformation dynamics, positive feedback loops, and strategic positioning but does not introduce new source material requiring citation.

---

## Section VII: Signaling Discontinuity

### Costly Signaling Theory

**Mercier, H. (2020).** *Not Born Yesterday: The Science of Who We Trust and What We Believe*. Princeton: Princeton University Press.

**Usage in Section VII:** Costly signals as credibility markers - signals that require genuine effort are harder to fake and thus more trustworthy. Applied to transparency requirements as both verification mechanism and quality signal.

**Cited passage concept:** People assess communication for trustworthiness partly through cost considerations.

**Status:** ✓ CITED in Section VII text

**LaTeX citation format:**
```latex
As Mercier (2020) argues in \textit{Not Born Yesterday}, people assess communication for trustworthiness partly through cost considerations—costly signals are harder to fake and thus more credible.
```
