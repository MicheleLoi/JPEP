# Section Guidance: Consolidated Section 2 (Systemic Barriers)

  

## Objective

Merge current sections 2, 3, and 4 into a single coherent section that eliminates redundancy while preserving key insights. Create unified analysis showing how multiple barriers interact to create the disclosure problem.

  

## Required Input Artifacts

- `Section 2` (The Incentive Structure of Disclosure)

- `Section 3` (Why Contiguous Approaches Fail)

- `Section 4` (The Problem of Unfair Reviews)

- `ModificationLog_Section_2` (for understanding evolution)

- `ModificationLog_Section_3` (for understanding evolution)

- `ModificationLog_Section_4` (for understanding evolution)

- `PatternSummaries` (for identifying overlapping arguments)

  

## New Structure: "Systemic Barriers to Disclosure"

  

### 2.1 The Incentive Gradient

**Source**: Current Section 2

**Preserve**:

- Core insight about asymmetric incentives (permanent disclosure, uncertain significance, front-loaded costs)

- The gradient where high-stakes work faces strongest pressure to underreport

- Specific mechanisms of underreporting (definitional flexibility, temporal discounting, comparative framing, strategic vagueness)

- The transparency paradox conclusion

  

**Condense**: Examples and elaboration that don't add new insights

  

### 2.2 Institutional Design Constraints  

**Source**: Current Sections 3-4 combined

**Preserve**:

- The dilemma: contiguous venues inherit incentive problems, discontinuous venues risk marginalization

- Specific examples of how prestige connections recreate the same pressures

- Evidence that even fair-minded reviewers face coordination problems

- Connection between incentive problems and evaluation problems

  

**Eliminate**:

- Repetitive restatements of the incentive gradient

- Separate treatment of venue design and review bias (show as connected problems)

  

### 2.3 Compound Effects

**Source**: New synthesis

**Content**: Brief analysis (2-3 paragraphs) showing how incentive misalignment and institutional constraints interact:

- Incentive problems make honest scholars avoid traditional venues

- This leaves venues populated by those willing to underreport

- Self-selection effects normalize strategic disclosure

- Creates downward spiral in transparency standards

  

## Guidelines for Consolidation

  

### Length Target

Approximately 3,000 words (roughly 2/3 of current combined length)

  

### What to Eliminate

- Repetitive restatements of the core incentive insight

- Overlapping examples that illustrate the same point

- Defensive clarifications that interrupt flow

- Separate introductory paragraphs for each section (merge into unified opening)

  

### What to Strengthen

- Connections between different barrier types

- Cumulative logic showing how problems compound

- Unified argumentation toward the need for alternative infrastructure

  

### Transitions

Create smooth transitions showing:

- How institutional constraints flow from incentive problems

- How compound effects emerge from both sources

- Why these systemic barriers require the alternative venue approach in Section 5

  

## Success Criteria

- Single coherent argument rather than three separate points

- No repetitive restatement of core insights

- Clear progression from individual incentives → institutional limits → systemic effects

- Maintains intellectual rigor while eliminating redundancy

- Sets up Section 5's motivation convincingly
