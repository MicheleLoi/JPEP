### 4.4.13 From Full Draft (+Appendix) to Section 6

PROMPT FOR SEPARATE INSTANCE - UPDATED VERSION

You are assisting with adding a new subsection to Section 6.2 ("The Transparency Framework") of an academic paper about AI-assisted scholarship.

CONTEXT:

This paper proposes transparency requirements for AI-assisted philosophical work. Section 6.2 describes the disclosure framework the author developed. However, this framework was not predetermined—it emerged through a process of "guided discovery" (Neurath's ship mode) while attempting to document the paper's own AI-assisted production.

TASK:

Write a new subsection (approximately 2-3 paragraphs) to be inserted in Section 6.2, right after the paragraph beginning "This paper provides a concrete implementation..."

CONTENT TO INCLUDE:

1\. Frame two infrastructural constraints as emergent discoveries (not anticipated problems)

2\. Present the constraints:

\- \*\*Temporal logging\*\*: LLM platforms lack timestamps; conversations are "open files" that can be returned to across days/weeks; reconstructing when insights emerged or how conversation threads influenced each other requires manual metadata addition

\- \*\*Synthesis challenge\*\*: Raw chatbot histories are messy (parallel windows, erratic user behavior, dead-ends); using LLM assistance to synthesize these histories risks hallucinating coherent-but-false accounts; human curation is labor-intensive; platforms lack structured summary features with user validation

3\. Explain that these constraints shaped both the documentation requirements and the specific approaches adopted

4\. Include a forward reference to Appendix A.2, which documents the actual complexity of reconstructing the development process (specifically mention Figure 2 and the branching, parallel processes, emergent documentation system visible there)

FRAMING REQUIREMENTS:

\- Tone: Analytical, not apologetic. These are infrastructure constraints the field must address, not personal limitations

\- Present these as discovered while developing the framework, not problems encountered while implementing a predetermined plan

\- Connect to the epistemological stakes: why these matter for transparency, not just usability

\- Frame the discovery temporally: "became apparent while constructing the developmental reconstruction" or similar language that emphasizes this emerged during the writing/documentation process itself

\- Maintain the paper's existing voice and academic register

POSITIONING:

This insertion bridges between describing what the framework requires (existing content above) and providing the concrete implementation details (existing content below). It explains why the framework looks the way it does—showing that the requirements emerged from encountering real infrastructural constraints during the documentation attempt.

OUTPUT:

Provide only the new subsection text, formatted as continuous prose suitable for direct insertion into the paper.
