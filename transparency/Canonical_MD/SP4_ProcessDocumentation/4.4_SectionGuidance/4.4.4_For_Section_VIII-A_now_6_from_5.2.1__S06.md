### 4.4.4 For Section VIII-A (now 6) from 5.2.1 
# Session Guidance: Sections 8-9 and Appendix A

  

**DOCUMENT TYPE: Session Guidance (Type 3)**

  

---

  

## Core Principle: The Paper Embodies Its Own Argument

  

**The argument (Sections 2-4):**

- Section 2: Prompts alone enable strategic underreporting

- Section 3: Contiguous venues inherit this problem  

- Section 4: Even willing scholars face barriers

  

**The solution:**

- Prompts alone (A) = gameable

- Prompts + process documentation (A+B) = resistant to gaming

- **This paper demonstrates its own proposal** (supplementary materials SP-1 through SP-5)

  

---

  

## SECTION 8: Review Mechanism

  

### Purpose

Present split-review system with reproduction-based sufficiency test. **Conceptual level, NOT technical specification.**

  

### Target Length

~1,200-1,500 words

  

### Structure and Content

  

**1. Split-Review Architecture (~300 words)**

- Reviewer A: Traditional quality assessment (paper only)

- Reviewer B: Sufficiency assessment via reproduction

- Two independent reviews, editor coordinates

  

**2. The Reproduction Task (~400 words)**

  

**Introduce "Reproduction Package" concept:**

- NOT raw conversation dumps

- Author-created compilation from process artifacts

- Contains: prompts, reasoning traces, refinement patterns, source integration notes, key insights checklist

  

**Explain types of process documentation:**

- **Modification Logs:** What changed and why during writing

- **Pattern Summaries:** Generalizable lessons learned  

- **Section Guidance:** Instructions for writing each section (structural deviations from base prompt)

- **Section Summaries:** What each section says (continuity)

- **Epistemic Traces:** Verbatim excerpts from exploratory conversations where ideas emerged

  - **Dual purpose:** (1) Document idea sources; (2) Preserve author's voice for tone/style learning

  

**Critical callback to Section 2:** Prompts alone insufficient. Process documentation shows HOW author shaped the work (A+B together resist gaming).

  

**3. What "Reproduction" Means (~300 words)**

- NOT identical outputs (stochastic systems)

- Testing: Did documented inputs plausibly determine this contribution?

- **Trajectory matching:** Intellectual architecture, key insights, argument structure

- Expected gap: Reproduction less polished (normal and acceptable)

  

**Pass threshold:** "Documented inputs sufficient to generate work of this character. Gap reflects expected refinement, not missing documentation."

  

**4. Two Purposes (~200 words)**

- **Sufficiency testing:** Were author's inputs sufficient for the contribution?

- **Authorship anchoring:** Author controlled "the difference that makes the difference"

  

Metaphor: Information compression/decompression (prompts as compressed specification, LLM decompresses using training)

  

**5. Practical Considerations (~200 words)**

- Reviewer burden: Pre-processed by author, bounded task (~10-14 hours total)

- Gaming resistance: Prompts + traces together reveal actual process

- Non-determinism: Acknowledged, seeking trajectory match not identical output

- Self-selection: Only genuinely transparent scholars submit

  

**6. Connection and Transition (~200 words)**

- Embodies A+B principle from Section 2

- Implements mandatory transparency from Section 7

- Creates methodological learning opportunity

- This paper demonstrates concept (see Appendix A and supplementary materials SP-1 through SP-5)

  

### Key Points

- Maintain philosophical tone (NOT technical specification)

- Show clear connection to paper's core argument

- Reference Appendix for details

- Use flowing prose (NO bullet points in body text)

## APPENDIX A: Reproduction Procedure Details

  

### Purpose

Bridge Section 8 (conceptual) and supplementary materials (actual artifacts). Detailed enough to evaluate plausibility, flexible enough to invite adaptation.

  

### Target Length

~3,000-4,000 words

  

### Structure and Content

  

**A.1: Overview of Reproduction Procedure (~400 words)**

  

**Three components:**

1. **Complete Prompt (SP-1):** Synthesized instructions for generating the paper

2. **Reproduction Package (SP-2):** Processed compilation from process documentation

3. **Reproduction Guide (SP-3):** Instructions for Reviewer B

  

**Reviewer B workflow (9-14 hours total):**

- Review materials (2-3 hours): Read SP-1, SP-2, SP-3

- Attempt reproduction (4-6 hours): Provide SP-1 + SP-2 to current LLM, generate comparable paper

- Compare outputs (2-3 hours): Use criteria from SP-3

- Judge (pass/fail): Were inputs sufficient?

- Spot-check if needed: Examine SP-4 to verify Reproduction Package derives from actual process

  

**A.2: The Reproduction Package (~600 words)**

  

**Why necessary:** Complete Prompt specifies WHAT to generate, Reproduction Package shows HOW author shaped it.

  

**Six-section structure:**

1. **Argument Architecture:** How sections build cumulatively, ordering rationale, dependencies

2. **Author Guidance Patterns:** Conceptual reframings required, refinement priorities, structural interventions

3. **Refinement Patterns:** Redundancy elimination, epistemic precision, style discipline, attribution standards

4. **Source Integration Strategy:** Sources by type, integration depth, primary vs. secondary usage

5. **Section Development Flow:** Section-by-section building, word counts, continuity mechanisms, critical moves

6. **Key Insights Checklist:** Essential intellectual moves that must appear in reproduction

  

**How generated:** Author uses preprocessing prompt with process documentation (SP-4) as input. Single-step generation for typical papers. Output: ~10-15 pages.

  

**A.3: Process Documentation Types (~800 words)**

  

**This section defines the 10 document types reviewers will find in supplementary materials:**

  

**From writing process (created per section):**

  

1. **Modification Logs:** Detailed records of what changed and why during writing. Show iterative refinement. Include modification ID (numbering restarts at MOD-001 for each section), what changed, rationale, related patterns.

  

2. **Pattern Summaries:** Generalizable lessons learned from writing each section. Extracted from Modification Logs. Reusable guidance for similar work.

  

3. **Section Guidance:** Instructions for writing each section, specifying structural deviations from Complete Prompt, continuity requirements, forward connections. Created before writing next section.

  

4. **Section Summaries:** What each section says. Core argument, key moves, structure. Used to maintain coherence across writing sessions.

  

**From exploratory conversations:**

  

5. **Epistemic Traces:** Verbatim excerpts (with redactions) from LLM conversations outside standard writing process. Capture where key ideas first emerged.

   - **Dual purpose:**

     - (1) Documentation: Trace intellectual influences and idea sources

     - (2) Tone/style preservation: Preserve author's authentic voice for LLM to learn from

   - Examples: Early conceptual explorations, methodological discussions, conversations where insights emerged

  

**From prompt development:**

  

6. **Prompt Development Log:** Evolution of Complete Prompt through iterations. Shows architectural decisions, how author's understanding developed. Uses PDL-001, PDL-002, etc. (distinct from section Modification Logs).

  

**Final materials (for reproduction):**

  

7. **Complete Prompt (SP-1):** Synthesized instructions for generating the paper

  

8. **Reproduction Package (SP-2):** Processed compilation generated from types 1-6

  

9. **Reproduction Guide (SP-3):** Instructions for Reviewer B on conducting reproduction test

  

**Additional:**

  

10. **Notes:** Working documents, organization instructions, not methodologically relevant (not included in final supplementary materials)

  

**A.4: This Paper's Supplementary Materials (~500 words)**

  

**Self-application principle:** This paper documented according to proposed standards.

  

**Five files (SP-1 through SP-5):**

  

**SP-1: Complete Prompt**

- Synthesized instructions for paper

- All sections 1-9 specified

- References with relevance assessments

- Tone and style requirements

  

**SP-2: Reproduction Package**  

- Six-section structure (see A.2)

- Generated from SP-4 via preprocessing

- ~10-15 pages

- Demonstrates what sufficiency-level documentation looks like

  

**SP-3: Reproduction Guide**

- Reviewer B instructions

- How to combine SP-1 + SP-2

- Comparison criteria

- Pass threshold definition

- Spot-check procedures

  

**SP-4: Process Documentation (consolidated)**

- Part 1: Modification Logs (all paper sections, numbering restarts at MOD-001 per section, maintained within section headers)

- Part 2: Pattern Summaries (lessons learned)

- Part 3: Section Guidance (instructions per section)

- Part 4: Section Summaries (argument flow)

- Part 5: Epistemic Traces (with redactions)

- ~30-50 pages

  

**SP-5: Development Records (consolidated)**

- Part 1: Prompt Development Log

- Part 2: Epistemic Trace - Methodology Design (how this procedure emerged)

- Part 3: Reference Verification Notes

- Part 4: Other development materials

- ~20-30 pages

  

**Total:** ~70-100 pages across 5 files

  

**Limitations acknowledged:** Proof-of-concept, not validated system. Community calibration needed.

  

**A.5: Guide to Using Supplementary Materials (~400 words)**

  

**For Reviewer B (attempting reproduction):**

1. Read SP-1 (Complete Prompt) - understand what paper aims to do

2. Read SP-2 (Reproduction Package) - understand how author shaped it

3. Read SP-3 (Reproduction Guide) - note instructions and criteria

4. Provide SP-1 + SP-2 to current LLM

5. Generate comparable paper following SP-3

6. Compare using criteria in SP-3

7. If reproduction fails: Spot-check SP-4 to verify SP-2 derives from actual process

  

**For methodological researchers:**

- Examine SP-4: See actual process documentation (Modification Logs with per-section numbering, Pattern Summaries, Epistemic Traces)

- Compare SP-4 to SP-2: How was Reproduction Package derived? Appropriate compression?

- Examine SP-5: Understand how materials were created

  

**For venue designers:**

- Study complete structure (SP-1 through SP-5)

- Adapt for your context

- Calibrate standards through practice

  

**A.6: Reproduction as Sufficiency Test (~500 words)**

  

**What "sufficiency" means:** Were documented inputs sufficient to determine this intellectual contribution?

  

**NOT asking:** Could LLM do this alone? Is work entirely human? Can we reproduce exactly?

  

**Asking:** Did author meaningfully shape work? Is documentation honest? Were inputs sufficient?

  

**Two purposes explained:**

  

*Purpose 1: Sufficiency Testing*

- Metaphor: Information compression/decompression

- Author's inputs are compressed specification

- LLM decompresses using its training

- Test: Does compressed version contain essential information?

  

*Purpose 2: Authorship Anchoring*

- Shows author controlled "the difference that makes the difference"

- Not passive acceptance or chance

- But intentional structuring through meaningful guidance

  

**Pass threshold elaborated:**

- Structural similarity: Same argument architecture, major moves present

- Philosophical sophistication: Comparable depth and insight

- Key insights: Checklist items from SP-2 Section 6 present

- Refinement quality: Patterns appropriately applied

  

**Expected gap (acceptable):**

- Less polished prose

- Different examples or phrasing

- Possibly shorter or less developed in places

- Gap shows refinement beyond documented inputs

  

**Fail threshold:** Missing core arguments, fundamentally different approach, key insights absent

  

**A.7: Relationship to Other Approaches (~300 words)**

  

**Compare to:**

- Traditional peer review: No process access, no verification mechanism

- Software reproducibility: Bit-identical outputs, deterministic systems, exhaustive version control

- Current AI policies: Disclosure without verification, ambiguous thresholds

  

**This approach:**

- Process AND product evaluated

- Trajectory similarity, not identical outputs

- Compressed documentation, not exhaustive logs

- Sufficiency test appropriate for philosophy

  

**A.8: Expected Evolution (~400 words)**

  

**Acknowledged limitations:**

- Community standards need calibration through practice

- Pass thresholds need refinement through experience

- Documentation burden may need adjustment

- Comparison criteria will evolve

  

**Expected evolution:**

- Templates and best practices will emerge

- Different fields may need variations

- Tools may be developed to assist

- Community feedback will shape development

  

**Principles to preserve:**

1. Prompts + process documentation together (A+B)

2. Good faith orientation (not adversarial)

3. Reproduction as sufficiency test (not determinism test)

4. Practical feasibility (bounded time, sustainable)

  

**Adaptation encouraged:** This is starting point. Venues should experiment. Community learning expected.

  

**A.9: Conclusion (~100 words)**

  

This appendix bridges Section 8's conceptual description and supplementary materials' worked example. Provides detail to evaluate plausibility without prescribing rigid requirements. Honest about being proof-of-concept. Invites adaptation and evolution through practice.
