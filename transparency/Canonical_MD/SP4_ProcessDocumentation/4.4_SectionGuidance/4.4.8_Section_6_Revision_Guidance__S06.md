### 4.4.8 Section 6 Revision Guidance

Objective

Moderate confidence levels for transformation mechanisms while preserving analytical framework.

Specific Changes Needed

**Uncertainty Markers**: Add explicit qualifiers

"Four plausible dynamics might enable transformation..."

"If these mechanisms operate as predicted..."

"This represents one possible trajectory..."

**Language Moderation**: Replace certainty with possibility

"Will" → "might" or "could"

"Inevitable" → "plausible"

"Systematic" → "potential"

**Hypothesis Framing**: Present mechanisms as testable hypotheses requiring empirical validation rather than confident predictions

**Preserve**

Four mechanism framework (system degradation, feedback loops, external recognition, prestige inversion)

Dynamic vs. static analysis distinction

Strategic positioning argument

Analytical rigor
