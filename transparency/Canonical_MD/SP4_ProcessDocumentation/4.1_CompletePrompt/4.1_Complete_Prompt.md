## 4.1 Complete Prompt

**Context and Central Problem**

Write an academic philosophy paper arguing for the creation of a new venue for AI-assisted scholarship. This venue should be understood broadly: it can be a distinct journal OR a special track within an existing journal. The essential feature is a dedicated review process with distinct requirements for AI-assisted work.

**The central problem:** When scholars develop arguments through AI-assisted dialogue and disclose this openly, current academic publishing creates barriers. The work must be "laundered" through substantial human rewriting to enter formal venues. Scholars face a choice:

Cite and build - write new paper citing the AI-assisted work (compliant but inefficient)

Complete reformulation - rewrite entirely (ambiguous - is this plagiarism of the argument?)

Co-authorship with AI disclosure (probably compliant but unclear)

Attribution without authorship - rewrite with acknowledgment (grey zone)

None of these options allow the collaboratively-produced argument to enter formal venues directly with full disclosure.

**Key Argument About Incentives**

The paper must develop this critical insight about incentive structures:

**For papers authors believe may be prestigious/career-defining:**

Maximum incentive to underreport AI involvement

Disclosure becomes permanently attached to high-value career asset

"This might define my career, so I can't mark it as substantially AI-assisted"

**For minor/forgettable papers:**

Lower cost to disclose honestly

"It's just another paper"

**Result:** The most important work has the strongest incentives for dishonesty. Exactly where transparency is most needed, we get the least.

**The fatal flaw of contiguous approaches:** If a new venue positions itself as:

"Work here might get cited in prestigious journals"

"Could become part of traditional scholarly record"

"We'll see if it gets recognized after 2-3 years"

Then authors face the SAME incentives to underreport, even in the new venue. Because: "What if this becomes my most-cited paper? I should say 30% AI involvement, not 70%, just in case."

**The fundamental tension:**

If venue seeks validation from traditional system → traditional norms reassert themselves

If venue explicitly breaks from traditional system → becomes ghetto, authors don't care

**The Problem of Unfair Reviews**

Even when authors are willing to disclose AI assistance fully, the current review system creates additional barriers. This paper itself serves as a test case for this hypothesis.

**The prediction:** When this paper is submitted to traditional philosophy journals with full disclosure of substantial AI assistance, editors will find it difficult to give it a fair chance of review for two reasons:

**Reviewer resistance:** Some reviewers will react negatively to being asked to review what they regard as "AI slop," regardless of argument quality. The disclosure itself triggers dismissal.

**Editorial risk aversion:** Even editors who might be willing to consider the work fairly will be wary of alienating reviewers by sending them AI-assisted submissions. The professional cost of appearing to take such work seriously may outweigh commitment to evaluate arguments on merit.

**The epistemic consequence:** If the paper is rejected for reasons related to AI disclosure rather than argument quality, this validates the need for an alternative venue. If it is accepted, this demonstrates traditional venues can handle disclosed AI-assisted work, weakening (but not eliminating) the case for alternatives.

Either outcome provides valuable empirical evidence about current publishing norms and their relationship to methodological transparency.

**Why Scholars Should Engage with AI-Assisted Scholarship**

Beyond the critique of current barriers, the paper must provide positive motivations for scholarly engagement with AI-assisted work:

**Explorative Knowledge and Wonder**

Many scholars experience genuine wonder at AI capabilities. This sense of wonder is a classical philosophical motivation for inquiry—not mere novelty-seeking but authentic curiosity about new domains of investigation. The capacity to explore these capabilities through collaborative work with AI systems represents legitimate philosophical interest.

*Reference classical philosophical sources on wonder as motivation for inquiry*

**A Posteriori Knowledge in Philosophy**

The project reflects a vision of philosophy that values a posteriori knowledge alongside a priori speculation. A priori reasoning is fruitful insofar as it guides exploration of reality and generates empirical knowledge. This aligns with pragmatist traditions (Quine and others) that reject sharp analytic/synthetic distinctions and emphasize continuity between philosophical and empirical investigation.

*See Reference List B for pragmatist sources with relevance assessments*

**Philosophy of Technology: Creativity, Tools, and the Deweyan Imperative**

**General principle:** Technology is not merely a shortcut to achieve predetermined results but serves as a medium of creativity that enables genuinely novel outcomes. This theme appears in:

Byrne, D. (2012). *How Music Works*. Edinburgh: Canongate.

Byrne's analysis of how different technologies (recording studios, concert halls, synthesizers) don't just facilitate but fundamentally shape musical creativity

Wheeler, M. (2018). "Talking about more than Heads: the Embodied, Embedded and Extended Creative Mind." In B. Gaut & M. Kieran (eds.), *Creativity and Philosophy*. London: Routledge, pp. 230-250.

Philosophical analysis arguing the creative mind is embodied, embedded, and extended through tools and environment

**Specific analogy:** The relationship between musicians and analog synthesizers parallels the relationship between scholars and AI in "distant writing" (Floridi). In both cases:

The tool doesn't simply execute pre-formed intentions

Interactive exploration with the medium generates novel possibilities

The output emerges from human-tool collaboration rather than pure human agency

Understanding the process requires examining the extended cognitive system, not just the individual mind

*Reference: Floridi's work on distant writing (see Reference List A)*

**The Deweyan imperative for AI-assisted scholarship:**

There exists extensive philosophical debate about the distinction between authentic human minds and agentic entities that lack defining characteristics of intelligence. Floridi (2025) argues that AI is better understood as a new form of agency without intelligence—systems capable of action but lacking cognition, intention, or mental states (the Multiple Realisability of Agency thesis).

If philosophers follow Dewey's (1925) methodological guidance regarding LLMs, we should recognize a crucial gap. Dewey criticized philosophers for taking from science but failing to bring "deliverances of their reasoning back to the things of ordinary experience, in all their coarseness and crudity, for verification" (p. 34-35). Philosophy operates without a complete feedback loop.

In genuinely Deweyan fashion, we should be interested in **testing the consequences of philosophical reflection with the data of experience**. The production of AI-assisted philosophical artifacts contributes to:

Verifying or falsifying philosophical theses about AI capabilities and limitations

Clearly displaying the actual (not merely imagined) contributions of machine "intelligence" to philosophical theorizing

Understanding through practice, not just abstract speculation

**Why extensive exploration is necessary (not just controlled experiments):**

The activity of philosophizing is central to human self-definition. Nothing less than extensive exploration suffices—we cannot trust the results of a few controlled scientific experiments. We must switch from the controlled experiment mindset to what Mill called "experiments of life": real-world, practical, sustained engagement with these tools in actual philosophical work.

Such experiments carry high costs. High costs can only be borne with a broader collaborative structure. **This is what the proposed venue would enable:** a space where philosophers can conduct these "experiments of life" transparently, sharing both successes and failures, building cumulative knowledge about the genuine possibilities and limitations of AI-assisted philosophical work.

*References: Floridi (2025) on agency without intelligence; Dewey (1925, Ch. 1, pp. 31-35) on philosophy as experimental guidance*

**Methodological Contribution and Accountability**

The prompt transcripts and dialogue records serve as a methodological dataset. Understanding how productive AI-assisted philosophy actually works requires examining real cases, not just abstract speculation about what might happen.

**Proposed Solution (Two Components)**

**Component 1: Signal Discontinuity from Prestige System**

The venue must make clear this is a different game, not seeking eventual validation from traditional metrics:

Be understood broadly: can be a distinct journal OR a special track within an existing journal

Explicitly NOT seek indexing in traditional databases (initially)

NOT be designed to "count" for tenure/promotion

Serve scholars who value methodological contribution over credential accumulation

Opt OUT of prestige competition, not trying to win it differently

**Critical goal specification:** The purpose is producing valuable knowledge—both about the process of AI-assisted scholarship and in substantive outcomes. This is NOT about rewarding individual merit or credentialing. This distinguishes the venue from the credential-granting function of traditional publishing.

**Why discontinuity is necessary—a sophisticated justification:**

The question arises: if the procedural safeguards work (mandatory prompts, split review, reproduction test), why is discontinuity needed? Wouldn't the reproduction test catch underreporting regardless of whether papers appear in traditional databases?

The answer is **not** that procedures are insufficient. The reproduction test likely WOULD detect manipulation effectively. The issue is **participant selection and community norms**.

**Current academic incentive landscape:**

The academic job market and publishing environment creates strong pressures against genuine transparency about AI use:

Publications that don't count for tenure/hiring represent unaffordable opportunity costs for most scholars

Cultural stigma against AI assistance persists despite widespread covert use

Risk asymmetry: disclosure carries professional downside (work dismissed as lacking rigor) with minimal upside

Institutional incentives haven't shifted to reward methodological transparency

Credential inflation increases pressure for every publication to count maximally

This environment has persisted for some time and shows no signs of changing soon.

**The problem without discontinuity:** If papers count for tenure and appear in traditional venues, scholars primarily motivated by credential accumulation will submit to gain traditional credit while minimizing transparency costs. Even though procedural safeguards would eventually catch manipulation, the review process would be overwhelmed by submissions from those less committed to genuine transparency. The minority genuinely committed to methodological transparency would be swamped.

**Discontinuity serves as cultural filter:** By explicitly not counting for traditional metrics, the venue self-selects for scholars who value methodological knowledge over credentials. This isn't because procedures need the help—it's because establishing community norms requires the right initial participants.

**Strategic and potentially temporary:** This discontinuity may not be permanent. Once the venue establishes strong norms of genuine transparency and demonstrates value, integration with traditional venues could be reconsidered. The goal is to build a community first, then expand access.

**Component 2: Mandatory Full Methodological Transparency**

The venue requires dual submission: paper + complete methodological disclosure

**Submission requirements:**

Paper (standard format)

Full prompts or representative sample

Dialogue transcripts showing key argument development

Reflection on what worked/didn't work in the collaboration

**Human author commitment:** A necessary (though not sufficient) condition for submission is the author's commitment to stand behind the full textual result. The author must treat every claim as if they had written it themselves, taking full responsibility for accuracy, cogency, and integrity.

**Why this solves the incentive problem:**

**Self-selects for honesty:** Only people genuinely comfortable with full transparency will submit. Solves underreporting through selection, not monitoring.

**Creates positive externality:** Methodological disclosures become dataset. Other scholars learn how AI-assisted philosophy actually works.

**Reframes venue's purpose:** Not "where AI-assisted papers hide" but "where we openly share how to do AI-assisted scholarship well."

**Establishes accountability:** Human commitment requirement ensures authors cannot disclaim responsibility for AI-generated content.

**Essential feature:** Dedicated review process with distinct requirements for AI-assisted work (see Review Mechanism section below).

**Proposed Review Mechanism**

The paper should propose this split-reviewer system:

**Submission requires:** Paper + full methodological disclosure (prompts/dialogue transcripts)

**Split review:**

Reviewer A: Reviews paper WITHOUT seeing methodological disclosure

Reviewer B: Reviews methodological disclosure WITHOUT seeing paper initially

**Reviewer B's dual role:**

Assess methodological disclosure for scientific quality (process rigor, philosophical insight in dialogue)

Test robustness: Reproduce procedure with state-of-art LLM, then produce independent review of resulting paper content and quality

**The reproduction requirement serves two distinct purposes:**

**Purpose 1: Sufficiency Testing**

Reproducing the paper from the prompts determines whether the author's input is sufficient to generate the intellectual advancement valued by the review (abstracting from stylistic details and exact formulations). This can be understood through several metaphors:

*Information theory:* The prompts function as compressed information that can be "unzipped" by the LLM. The test checks whether the compressed version contains the essential intellectual content.

*Biological metaphor:* The author's input is like a seed, while the LLM represents the soil (compressed summary of all digitized human discourse). The author's role is sufficient for causing the knowledge output, but only in the context of this particular soil.

*Analytic philosophy metaphor:* \[The paper should develop or suggest an appropriate metaphor suited to analytic philosophy conventions\]

This is not about whether the LLM "could have" produced the work independently, but whether the author's specific inputs functionally determine the substantive contribution when operating through this medium.

**Purpose 2: Anchoring Authorship**

The reproduction test helps establish that the author is genuinely responsible for the main ideas, not through mere endorsement of LLM output, but through meaningful control. The author must control "the difference that makes the difference"—the right difference.

This distinguishes genuine authorship from two failure modes:

*Mere endorsement:* Passively accepting whatever the LLM produces

*Chance:* Accidentally stumbling upon good output through trial and error

When Reviewer B can reproduce the core intellectual contribution from the author's prompts, this demonstrates the author exercised meaningful causal control over the outcome. The author is responsible not despite the AI mediation, but through intentional structuring of that mediation.

**Editor:** Checks coherence between the two independent reviews

**Methodological Requirement for This Paper**

**CRITICAL:** This paper itself must be written using substantial AI assistance and must disclose this transparently. The paper serves as its own proof-of-concept and experimental test case.

**This paper cannot afford strategically minimal disclosure.** It is arguing that full transparency should become the norm. Anything less than maximum disclosure would be hypocritical and undermine the entire argument. The disclosure itself IS part of the argument—it demonstrates what you're advocating.

**Structure of Disclosure**

**PRELIMINARY NOTE (before main argument begins):**

The paper must begin with a Preliminary Note containing:

**Direct statement:** "This paper was written through iterative AI-assisted dialogue."

**Generic procedural description:** "The argument was developed through the following process: prompts were extracted from prior conversations and synthesized; coherence checking was performed between prompt and source material; modifications were tracked systematically; iterative refinement was conducted based on identified incoherences."

**Honest assessment of degree of involvement:** \[Author must provide specific, honest characterization - e.g., "substantial throughout all stages" or "primarily in argument structuring and refinement"\]

**Reference to supplementary materials:** "Complete prompts, dialogue excerpts showing argument development, and full procedural documentation are available as supplementary materials."

**Brief justification:** "This transparency models the methodological disclosure standards this paper proposes for AI-assisted scholarship."

**SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:**

Must include:

**Full prompt** (the prompt artifact developed in this process)

**Key dialogue excerpts** showing how arguments were developed and refined

**Epistemic trace** (original conversation text with privacy-preserving elisions)

**Discontinuity discussion** (full reasoning about venue design and necessity)

**Modification tracker** (showing iterative refinements through MOD-### labels)

**Why This Structure**

**Philosophy journal conventions:** Philosophy papers don't typically have Methods sections. A Preliminary Note before the main argument is the appropriate location for methodological disclosure - it's upfront, honest, and non-disruptive to philosophical argumentation.

**Maximum transparency required:** This paper IS the experimental test case. If editors reject it because of the disclosure rather than argument quality, this validates the need for an alternative venue. If they accept it, this demonstrates traditional venues CAN handle full transparency when done properly.

**The disclosure demonstrates the proposal:** The Preliminary Note and Supplementary Materials show exactly what submission to the proposed venue would look like. It's not defensive - it's demonstrative.

**Tone and Style Requirements**

Write in dry, philosophical prose

Avoid emotional appeals or calls for sympathy

Present arguments rigorously with clear logical structure

Address counterarguments directly

Acknowledge when conclusions are uncertain or contingent

Do not use excessive formatting or rhetorical flourishes

**Paper Structure**

**Preliminary Note:** Full methodological disclosure (as specified above)

**Introduction:  **

**Opening:** Introduce Floridi's concept of "distant writing" as emblematic of emerging practices in AI-assisted scholarship

**Current debates in philosophy:** Frame using Daily Nous discussions

"Two Cultures" framing: two provocative claims about whether AI could improve philosophy

Teaching panic (Jollimore: "faith has been obliterated"; Berg: "rendering students subcognitive"; Rini: "miserable war of attrition")

Research potential (Ontiveros & Clay: AI could provide "suite of tools" to revolutionize philosophy if properly developed)

Moderate voices: "delegated writing" already common in sciences; argues against "AI exceptionalism"

**Journal policy landscape:** Unanimous position

AI tools cannot be listed as authors (COPE criteria: LLMs lack accountability, cannot approve final version)

Mandatory disclosure required (Elsevier, ACM, Science journals, etc.)

Study by Lund & Naheem (2023): over half of major journals have AI policies, typically requiring disclosure in Methods or Acknowledgments sections

**The paradox:** Policies demand transparency but transparency carries professional cost

Disclosure required for integrity

But disclosure triggers stigma ("AI slop"), reviewer resistance, editorial risk aversion

Creates incentive to minimize or hide AI involvement

Result: most important work (career-defining papers) has strongest incentives for dishonesty

**The missing infrastructure:** Four gaps not addressed by current debate

No venue for fully disclosed substantial AI-assisted work (all policies assume minimization)

No positive case for AI-assisted scholarship (entirely defensive framing)

Binary author vs. tool (no framework for distributed authorship/collaboration)

No mechanism for verifying disclosed AI involvement (policies require disclosure but no validation)

**This paper's intervention:** Proposes infrastructure rather than choosing side

Alternative venue where transparency valued, not penalized

Positive case for AI-assisted philosophical scholarship (not just threat mitigation)

Review mechanism that validates rather than polices disclosure

Addresses incentive structure directly

**Incentives Analysis:** Develop the argument about prestige and underreporting; why important work has strongest incentives for dishonesty

**Why Contiguous Approaches Fail:** Show how seeking validation from traditional system recreates the incentive problem

**The Problem of Unfair Reviews:** How disclosure triggers dismissal regardless of quality (using this paper as meta-test case)

**Positive Motivations:** Why scholars should engage with AI-assisted scholarship (wonder, a posteriori philosophy, creativity/tools, methodological contribution)

**Proposed Solution - Component 1:** Signal discontinuity from prestige system (with sophisticated justification about participant selection)

**Proposed Solution - Component 2:** Mandatory full methodological transparency with dual submission

**Review Mechanism:** Detail the split-reviewer system with thorough discussion of reproduction requirement (sufficiency testing and authorship anchoring)

**Conclusion:** Implications for scholarly publishing norms; note that this paper's submission trajectory provides empirical evidence

**Expected Outcomes**

The paper should conclude by noting that its own publication trajectory will be instructive:

If rejected by traditional venues due to AI disclosure → demonstrates the barrier exists and validates need for alternative venue

If accepted by traditional venues → weakens but doesn't eliminate the case for alternative venue

Either outcome provides valuable data about current norms and their relationship to methodological transparency

**Write the paper now, with full philosophical rigor and the required methodological disclosure.**
